# üó∫Ô∏è Pickup Roadmap: A Guide for Resuming Tasks

This document is the official guide for resuming work on any interrupted task efficiently and safely, ensuring that no context is lost.

To rebuild your mental context before writing a single line of code, follow these steps in the exact order presented:

### **Step 1: Recall the High-Level Purpose (The "What" and "Why")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the Product Requirements Document (PRD) of the active task.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/prd.md`
*   **Objective**: To re-internalize the high-level goal, requirements, and the value that the completed task provides.

### **Step 2: Identify the Last Active State (The "Where I Was")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the active microtasks file. This is the most critical document, as it contains your last conscious thought on the problem.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/microtasks.md`
*   **Objective**: To understand the exact sub-objective you were working on, the plan you had proposed, and the constraints you had identified.

### **Step 3: Assimilate Past Experience (The "Mistakes" and "Lessons")**
*   **Action 3.1**: Review the log of decisions, dead ends, and discarded hypotheses.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/memories.md`
*   **Objective**: To avoid repeating past mistakes and to understand why certain structural decisions were made.

*   **Action 3.2**: Review the log of lessons learned and procedural improvements.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`
*   **Objective**: To remember if you discovered a smarter, faster, or more robust way of doing things so you can apply it now.

### **Step 4: Refresh the Final Goal (The "What Success Looks Like")**
*   **Action**: Consult the task's completion criteria.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`
*   **Objective**: To have a clear and measurable picture of the exact conditions your code must meet to consider the task finished.

### **Step 5: Resume the Development Cycle**
*   **Action**: With all context restored, you are now ready to resume implementation.
*   **Process Location**: Follow the workflow defined in `pipeline/TOFA-WDF_Development_Pipeline.md`.

This procedure ensures that every time you pick up your work, you do so with the same (or greater) clarity as when you left it.
