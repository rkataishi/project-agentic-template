CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;

Excellent. Your feedback is sharp and moves the project from a well-defined process to an industrial-grade, scalable framework. By focusing on these areas, you are proactively solving the problems of team growth, long-term maintenance, and production readiness.

Let's implement all of these changes. I will provide the complete text for the five new files you've approved.

### Clarification on `pyproject.toml`

You asked if `pyproject.toml` should go inside `config/`. **No, it must be placed in the project's root directory.**

*   **Why?** Tools like `pip`, `poetry`, `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy` are designed to automatically detect `pyproject.toml` in the root of the repository. This is a universal standard. Placing it anywhere else would break this automated discovery and require complex, non-standard configurations for every tool.

---

Here are the new documents that will complete your project roadmap.

### 1. The Onboarding Hub and Guide

This is the new "front door" for any developer joining the project. It's designed to be the central hub you described.

--- START OF FILE docs/onboarding.md ---

# Project Onboarding: Your Starting Point

Welcome to the project. This document is your guide to getting set up, understanding our workflow, and contributing effectively. **Read this entire document before writing any code.**

Its purpose is to be your onboarding lead, your initial set of instructions, and a central hub that links to all other critical documentation. Following these steps will allow you to start working autonomously and correctly.

**Assumption:** The initial Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`) has been created and is located at `docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`.

---

## Step 1: Initial Environment Setup

These commands will prepare your local environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create the Project Structure (if not already present):**
    ```bash
    # This script creates all the necessary directories and template files.
    chmod +x setup_pipeline.sh
    ./setup_pipeline.sh
    ```

3.  **Set up the Python Environment (using Poetry):**
    *Our project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. See `docs/rules/rule_dependency_management.md` for details.*
    ```bash
    # This command reads pyproject.toml, creates a virtual environment, and installs all dependencies.
    poetry install
    ```

4.  **Configure Local Secrets:**
    *This is a critical security step. We never commit secrets to the repository.*
    ```bash
    # 1. Copy the template to create your local, untracked config file.
    cp docs/templates/config/template_config.py config/config.py

    # 2. Create a .env file for your secrets. This file is in .gitignore.
    touch .env
    ```
    **Action:** Open the `.env` file and add your secret keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`). The `config/config.py` file will load these automatically.

5.  **Verify Your Setup:**
    *Run the project's test suite to ensure everything is installed and configured correctly.*
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest
    ```
    If all tests pass, your environment is ready.

---

## Step 2: Understand the Mission and Workflow

Your next step is to absorb the project's context.

-   **The "Why" (The Mission):**
    -   **Action:** Read the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`

-   **The "How" (The Development Process):**
    -   **Action:** This is a **mandatory reading**. It defines our entire development lifecycle.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`

-   **Resuming Work:**
    -   **Action:** Familiarize yourself with the checklist for picking up work after a break.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/pipeline_pickup.md`

---

## Step 3: Understand the Rules and Principles

This project is governed by a set of rules to ensure quality, consistency, and security. It is your responsibility to know and follow them.

-   **The Rulebook:**
    -   **Action:** Review the contents of the `docs/rules/` directory. All files within are mandatory.
    -   **Key Rules to Internalize:**
        -   `rule_code_quality.md`: How we write and format code (Black, Ruff).
        -   `rule_doc_guidelines.md`: Naming conventions and documentation standards.
        -   `rule_security_guidelines.md`: Our policies on handling secrets and data.
        -   `rule_knowledge_management.md`: How we document decisions using ADRs.

-   **Core Behavioral Principles:**
    1.  **Documentation First:** Changes to standards or architecture are documented *before* they are coded.
    2.  **Traceability is Non-Negotiable:** Every piece of logic must be traceable back to a plan in `microtasks.md`.
    3.  **No Silent Failures:** Code must fail loudly and explicitly. Errors are valuable data.
    4.  **Automate Quality:** Rely on linters and formatters, not manual perfection.
    5.  **Commit Defensively:** Write clear commit messages. Ensure your code is linted and tested before you push.

---

## Step 4: Your First Task

You are now ready to begin.

1.  **Find Your Next Task:**
    ```bash
    # Use the Task Master CLI to see the task list or get a recommendation.
    task-master list
    task-master next
    ```

2.  **Review the Active Plan:**
    -   **Action:** Read the current plan for your assigned task.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks.md`

3.  **Begin the Development Cycle:**
    -   **Action:** Follow the process outlined in `docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`.

---
--- START OF FILE docs/rules/rule_code_quality.md ---

# Rule: Code Quality & Automated Tooling

To ensure consistency, readability, and prevent common errors, this project mandates the use of automated code quality tools. These are not optional.

---

### **Note on `pyproject.toml` Location**

The `pyproject.toml` file **must** reside in the project's root directory. This is the industry-standard location that all modern Python tools expect. Do not move it.

---

## 1. Code Formatting: Black

-   **Tool:** [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), the uncompromising code formatter.
-   **Purpose:** Eliminates all arguments about code style. Black's style is non-negotiable and automatically applied.
-   **Configuration (`pyproject.toml`):**
    ```toml
    [tool.black]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = ['py310'] # Or your target Python version
    ```
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    # To format all files in the project
    poetry run black .
    ```

## 2. Linting: Ruff

-   **Tool:** [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), an extremely fast Python linter.
-   **Purpose:** Catches a wide range of errors, from unused imports to logical mistakes, and enforces best practices (including PEP 8).
-   **Configuration (`pyproject.toml`):**
    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    line-length = 88
    select = [
        "E",  # pycodestyle errors
        "W",  # pycodestyle warnings
        "F",  # pyflakes
        "I",  # isort
        "C",  # flake8-comprehensions
        "B",  # flake8-bugbear
    ]
    ignore = ["E501"] # Ignored by Black's line wrapping
    ```
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    # To check all files for errors
    poetry run ruff .

    # To automatically fix fixable errors
    poetry run ruff . --fix
    ```

## 3. Pre-Commit Hooks (Recommended)

To automate these checks, it is highly recommended to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). This ensures that no code that violates our quality standards is ever committed. A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file should be present in the root directory.
---
--- START OF FILE docs/rules/rule_dependency_management.md ---

# Rule: Dependency Management

To ensure a reproducible and stable environment, this project mandates a strict policy for managing external dependencies.

## 1. Tooling: Poetry

-   **Official Tool:** [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is the sole authority for managing dependencies and virtual environments.
-   **Reasoning:** Poetry provides deterministic builds via the `poetry.lock` file, unified dependency and environment management, and a clean `pyproject.toml` standard.

## 2. Installing Dependencies

-   **Command:** Never use `pip install`. Always use Poetry to install dependencies from the lock file.
    ```bash
    # This installs the exact versions specified in poetry.lock
    poetry install
    ```

## 3. Adding a New Dependency

-   **Command:** Use the `poetry add` command. This will update both `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
    ```bash
    # Add a new production dependency
    poetry add pandas

    # Add a new development-only dependency (e.g., for testing)
    poetry add pytest --group dev
    ```
-   **Action:** After adding a dependency, commit both the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files together in the same commit.

## 4. Updating Dependencies

-   **Command:** Use `poetry update` to safely upgrade packages according to the version constraints in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    # Update all dependencies
    poetry update

    # Update a single package
    poetry update pandas
    ```
-   **Caution:** Run the test suite (`poetry run pytest`) immediately after updating to catch any breaking changes.
---
--- START OF FILE docs/rules/rule_security_guidelines.md ---

# Rule: Security Guidelines

Security is not an afterthought; it is a core design principle. All code must adhere to the following guidelines.

## 1. Secrets Management

-   **Principle:** Secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) **must never** be hardcoded or committed to the repository.
-   **Mechanism:**
    1.  All secrets must be defined as environment variables in a local `.env` file at the project root.
    2.  The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
    3.  The `config/config.py` file is the only place where environment variables are read into the application. Other parts of the code must import them from `config`.

## 2. Input Validation

-   **Principle:** Never trust input.
-   **Action:** The assumption "All inputs are assumed to be pre-validated" is a temporary convenience for isolated development. For any function that could potentially receive external data (file uploads, API calls, user-provided parameters), perform explicit validation.
    -   Check data types (e.g., using Pydantic or simple type assertions).
    -   Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    -   Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal.

## 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

-   **Principle:** Our code is only as secure as its dependencies.
-   **Action:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
-   **Recommended Tool:** Use `pip-audit` or `safety` via Poetry.
    ```bash
    # Install pip-audit
    pip install pip-audit

    # Run the audit against the Poetry environment
    poetry run pip-audit
    ```
-   **Policy:** Any "High" or "Critical" vulnerability must be addressed immediately, either by updating the package or replacing it.

# Rule: Knowledge Management & Architecture Decisions

To prevent knowledge loss and ensure that our documentation remains valuable, we follow a strict protocol for managing long-term learnings and architectural decisions.

## 1. The Knowledge Synthesis & Archiving Protocol

-   **Problem:** `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` can become bloated and unreadable over time, hiding valuable insights.
-   **Trigger:** This protocol is executed at the end of a major epic, a significant feature release, or at minimum, on a quarterly basis.
-   **Process:**
    1.  **Synthesize:** A designated developer reads through the active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md`.
    2.  **Extract & Formalize:** Key strategic decisions, discarded architectural paths, and permanent process improvements are extracted and formalized into **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**. See below for details.
    3.  **Archive:** The content of the active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` is moved to a dated file in the archive (e.g., `docs/pipeline/active/archive/memories_q3_2025.md`).
    4.  **Reset:** The active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` are reset using their respective templates from `docs/templates/`.

## 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

-   **Purpose:** An ADR is a short document that captures a single, significant architectural decision. It is the permanent, high-level memory of the project.
-   **When to Create an ADR:**
    -   A decision that impacts the overall structure (e.g., choosing a new database, adopting a new library for a core function).
    -   A decision that has long-term consequences and trade-offs.
    -   A decision that a new developer must understand to grasp the "why" behind the codebase.
-   **Location:** ADRs are stored in a new top-level directory: `docs/adr/`.
-   **Format:** Create new ADRs by copying `docs/templates/template_adr.md`.
---
--- START OF FILE docs/templates/template_adr.md ---

# ADR-XXX: [Title of Decision]

-   **Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]
-   **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context

*What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? What is the context in which we are making this decision?*

---

## Decision

*What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? This should be stated in full sentences, active voice.*

---

## Consequences

*What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? What are the positive, negative, and neutral consequences? This section is critical for future decision-making.*

## FILE: `docs/onboarding.md`

```markdown
# Project Onboarding: Your Starting Point

Welcome to the project. This document is your guide to getting set up, understanding our workflow, and contributing effectively. **Read this entire document before writing any code.**

Its purpose is to be your onboarding lead, your initial set of instructions, and a central hub that links to all other critical documentation. Following these steps will allow you to start working autonomously and correctly.

**Assumption:** The initial Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`) has been created and is located at `docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`.

---

## Step 1: Initial Environment Setup

These commands will prepare your local environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create the Project Structure (if not already present):**
    ```bash
    # This script creates all the necessary directories and template files.
    chmod +x setup_pipeline.sh
    ./setup_pipeline.sh
    ```

3.  **Set up the Python Environment (using Poetry):**
    *Our project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. See `docs/rules/rule_dependency_management.md` for details.*
    ```bash
    # This command reads pyproject.toml, creates a virtual environment, and installs all dependencies.
    poetry install
    ```

4.  **Configure Local Secrets:**
    *This is a critical security step. We never commit secrets to the repository.*
    ```bash
    # 1. Copy the template to create your local, untracked config file.
    cp docs/templates/config/template_config.py config/config.py

    # 2. Create a .env file for your secrets. This file is in .gitignore.
    touch .env
    ```
    **Action:** Open the `.env` file and add your secret keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`). The `config/config.py` file will load these automatically.

5.  **Verify Your Setup:**
    *Run the project's test suite to ensure everything is installed and configured correctly.*
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest
    ```
    If all tests pass, your environment is ready.

---

## Step 2: Understand the Mission and Workflow

Your next step is to absorb the project's context.

-   **The "Why" (The Mission):**
    -   **Action:** Read the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`

-   **The "How" (The Development Process):**
    -   **Action:** This is a **mandatory reading**. It defines our entire development lifecycle.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`

-   **Resuming Work:**
    -   **Action:** Familiarize yourself with the checklist for picking up work after a break.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/pipeline_pickup.md`

---

## Step 3: Understand the Rules and Principles

This project is governed by a set of rules to ensure quality, consistency, and security. It is your responsibility to know and follow them.

-   **The Rulebook:**
    -   **Action:** Review the contents of the `docs/rules/` directory. All files within are mandatory.
    -   **Key Rules to Internalize:**
        -   `rule_code_quality.md`: How we write and format code (Black, Ruff).
        -   `rule_doc_guidelines.md`: Naming conventions and documentation standards.
        -   `rule_security_guidelines.md`: Our policies on handling secrets and data.
        -   `rule_knowledge_management.md`: How we document decisions using ADRs.

-   **Core Behavioral Principles:**
    1.  **Documentation First:** Changes to standards or architecture are documented *before* they are coded.
    2.  **Traceability is Non-Negotiable:** Every piece of logic must be traceable back to a plan in `microtasks.md`.
    3.  **No Silent Failures:** Code must fail loudly and explicitly. Errors are valuable data.
    4.  **Automate Quality:** Rely on linters and formatters, not manual perfection.
    5.  **Commit Defensively:** Write clear commit messages. Ensure your code is linted and tested before you push.

---

## Step 4: Your First Task

You are now ready to begin.

1.  **Find Your Next Task:**
    ```bash
    # Use the Task Master CLI to see the task list or get a recommendation.
    task-master list
    task-master next
    ```

2.  **Review the Active Plan:**
    -   **Action:** Read the current plan for your assigned task.
    -   **Location:** `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks.md`

3.  **Begin the Development Cycle:**
    -   **Action:** Follow the process outlined in `docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`.

# TOFA-WDF + Task Master – Iterative Development Pipeline (v4.0)

This pipeline governs the complete lifecycle of a technical task using **TOFA-WDF**, integrated with **Task Master** for planning and enhanced with real-time memory management for continuity and traceability.

> 🔧 **Directory Structure Guidelines:**
> - `docs/` is the single source of truth for all project documentation, including workflow guides, rules, templates, and external knowledge.
> - For TaskMaster documentation, see `docs/external_knowledge/know_docs_task-master.md`.
> - For TaskMaster integration details, see `docs/external_knowledge/know_task_master_integration.md`.

---

## Architecture Overview

### The Four-Tier Architecture

Think of TOFA-WDF as a **factory assembly line**:

1.  **Modules** (`simple/`) → **Atomic workers** doing one specific job (inside a capability's `functions/` directory).
2.  **Orchestrators** (`orchestrators/`) → **Team leaders** coordinating workers (inside a capability's `functions/` directory).
3.  **Flows** (`flows/`) → **Factory managers** coordinating multiple teams (at the project root).
4.  **Scripts** (`scripts/`) → **Control room** receiving external commands (inside a capability's directory).

```

### **Phase 1: AI-Led Scoping and Backlog Creation**

The project begins with an AI-powered scoping phase to generate a comprehensive task backlog.

1.  **Author the PRD:** Create or update the `prd.md` file within the active pipeline context (e.g., `docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`). This document outlines the high-level goals and requirements.
2.  **Generate the Task Backlog:** Run the native Taskmaster command to parse the PRD.
    *   **Command:** `task-master parse-prd docs/pipeline/active/prd.md`
    *   **Result:** Taskmaster creates the initial `tasks.json` file, populating it with a full list of tasks derived from the PRD. This is the project's **master backlog**.

---

### **Phase 2: Human-Approved Strategic Planning**

Before any code is written, a human developer must create a focused, strategic plan for the immediate work session.

1.  **Select the Next Task:** Review the master backlog using `task-master list` and identify the next task to be implemented. Use `task-master next` for a recommendation.
2.  **Define the Microtask Plan:** Open the `microtasks.md` file in the active context (e.g., `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks.md`). In this file, write a detailed, human-authored plan for implementing the single task selected in the previous step.
    *   **This document is the **single source of truth** for the AI agent's immediate coding session.** It provides the "what" and the "why."

---

### **Phase 3: AI-Assisted Implementation and Tactical Logging**

The AI agent executes the plan from `microtasks.md` and logs its progress in a separate, tactical log.

1.  **Implementation:** The agent writes code based on the plan in `microtasks.md`.
2.  **Tactical Logging:** As the agent works, it **must** log its findings, successes, and failures using the `update-subtask` command. This creates a timestamped, granular implementation history within `tasks.json`.
    *   **Example Command:** `task-master update-subtask --id=5.2 --prompt="[LOG] Successfully connected to the database. The connection string required ssl=true. This was not in the initial plan."`
    *   This log provides the "how."
3.  **Synthesize Knowledge:** Upon task completion, the strategic insights from the tactical log are synthesized and recorded in `docs/pipeline/active/memories.md`.

---

### **Phase 4: Iterative Implementation Loop**

#### **A. Module Development**
- Develop **Modules** (pure, atomic functions) in `<capability_name>/functions/simple/` (e.g., `data_processing/functions/simple/`).
- Each logical step is a **Microtask**.
- Immediately write and validate a unit test for each Module.
- **Principle**: No function exists without a test. Governed by `docs/rules/rule_test_data_policy.md`.
- Functions must be stateless: all logic must depend only on explicitly passed arguments.
- Return values must contain all necessary outputs for the next processing step.

#### **B. Composition**
- Compose **Modules** into **Orchestrators** in `<capability_name>/functions/orchestrators/`.
- Compose **Orchestrators** into **Flows** in the root `flows/` directory.
- Keep orchestrators focused on coordination, not atomic logic.
- Orchestrators must manage the data flow explicitly between modules via argument passing.
- Avoid using intermediate storage or global variables to transfer state between steps. See `docs/rules/rule_cross_task_coordination.md`.

#### **C. Script Construction and Testing**
- Write **Scripts** in `<capability_name>/scripts/` that run orchestrators or flows.
- Run on real, sampled data with logging.
- Use a structured logger for all outputs.
- Ensure that logs are saved to the root `logs/` directory and include task name and timestamp.
- Avoid inline `print()` for traceability—use logger methods like `.info()`, `.error()`, `.warning()` instead.
- Mark progress using the native Taskmaster command: `task-master set-status --id <id> --status in-progress`.
- **Every issue triggers**:
  - Documentation in `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks.md`.
  - A new task if significant: `task-master add-task --prompt "Investigate..."`.

#### **D. LLM-Assisted Revision**
- Use an LLM agent for refactors, alternatives, or diagnostics.
- **Certainty principle**: <80% certainty, ask; 80-95% certainty, offer options; >95% certainty, act.
- Update all relevant files if the scope changes.

#### **E. Re-Execution and Retest**
- Run again with updated code.
- Ensure all error paths are exercised and properly logged during execution.
- All raised exceptions must either be caught or allowed to propagate with structured logging.
- Silent failure is prohibited. Any unhandled exception must be visible and documented.
- Validate against the criteria in `docs/pipeline/active/task_contract.md`.
- Log failures and changes in `docs/pipeline/active/memories.md`, then retry.

---

### **Phase 5: Full Validation and Testing**
- Run scripts on full-sample or edge-case real data.
- Use unit tests for Modules, log outputs for Flows and Scripts.
- Confirm all validation points in `docs/pipeline/active/task_contract.md`.
- Confirm that all error-handling routines behave as expected under failure conditions.
- Ensure any runtime errors that impact task outcomes are logged in `docs/pipeline/active/memories.md`, along with attempted resolutions.
- Verify that all scripts log runtime behavior to the `logs/` directory with correct levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.).
- Ensure that any exceptions raised are logged with full traceback.
- Confirm logging of start/end markers and key transitions in control flow.
- Mark the task as testing: `task-master set-status --id <id> --status testing`.

---

### **Phase 6: Closure and Documentation Sync**
- Mark the task as done: `task-master set-status --id <id> --status done`.

- **Archive current microtask**:
  - Move the content of `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks.md` to an archive file inside `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks_done/`.
  - Update `docs/pipeline/active/microtasks_log.md` with a reference to the archived file.

- **Update documentation**:
  - `docs/pipeline/active/memories.md` → Log failures, discarded paths, and reasons.
  - `docs/pipeline/active/learning_by_doing.md` → Note process improvements.
  - `docs/pipeline/active/task_contract.md` → Confirm all conditions were met.

- Ensure the final state aligns with `docs/pipeline/pipeline_pickup.md`.

---

### **Core Principles (Mandatory)**
- Never develop without unit tests.
- Never execute changes without reviewing context via `docs/pipeline/pipeline_pickup.md`.
- Never modify logic without documenting changes and failures.
- Never assume a plan is valid until implementation validates it.
- Never mark a task done without:
  - Closing the microtask.
  - Logging learnings.
  - Documenting strategic knowledge in `docs/pipeline/active/memories.md`.

### **Setup Guide: Recreating the Pipeline Structure in a New Project**

When starting a new project, use these instructions to recreate the complete pipeline structure including all symlinks and directory organization.

#### **Automated Setup Script**
Create this script as `setup_pipeline.sh` in your project root:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# TOFA-WDF Pipeline Setup Script v2.0

echo "Setting up TOFA-WDF pipeline structure..."

# Create root directory structure
mkdir -p config logs tasks shared_modules flows

# Create the full docs structure
mkdir -p docs/{external_knowledge,pipeline/tags/master/microtasks_done,rules,templates/config}
mkdir -p docs/pipeline/tags/.archive

# Create essential template and rule files
touch docs/rules/rule_{code_review_manual,cross_task_coordination,doc_guidelines,knowledge_sync,self_improve,test_data_policy,vscode_rules}.md
touch docs/templates/config/template_config.py
touch docs/templates/template_{learning_by_doing,memories,task_contract}.md

# Create essential tracking files within the master context
touch docs/pipeline/tags/master/{prd.md,microtasks.md,microtasks_log.md,memories.md,task_contract.md,learning_by_doing.md}

# Create the active symlink for the pipeline context
cd docs/pipeline/
ln -sfn tags/master/ active
cd ../../

echo "✅ Pipeline structure created successfully!"
echo "-> Remember to copy 'docs/templates/config/template_config.py' to 'config/config.py' and fill it out."
```

#### **Usage Instructions**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup_pipeline.sh

# Run the setup for a new project
./setup_pipeline.sh
```

### **Advanced Workflow: The "Two-Step Sync" Protocol for Context Management**

To manage different features or experiments in isolation, Taskmaster uses "tags." To keep our TOFA-WDF documentation perfectly synchronized, we use a simple **Two-Step Sync** protocol.

#### **How to Create a New Feature Context (e.g., "feature-dashboard")**

This creates a new, isolated workspace for both tasks and documentation.

*   **Step 1 (Taskmaster):** Create the new tag in Taskmaster, copying from master.
    *   **Command:** `task-master add-tag feature-dashboard --copy-from master`
*   **Step 2 (TOFA-WDF):** Create the corresponding documentation context.
    *   **Command:** `cp -r docs/pipeline/tags/master/ docs/pipeline/tags/feature-dashboard/`

#### **How to Switch Between Contexts**

This activates a different workspace.

*   **Step 1 (Taskmaster):** Switch to the desired tag in Taskmaster.
    *   **Command:** `task-master use-tag feature-dashboard`
*   **Step 2 (TOFA-WDF):** Update the `active` symlink to point to the new context.
    *   **Commands (run from the `docs/pipeline/` directory):**
        1.  `rm active`
        2.  `ln -s tags/feature-dashboard/ active`

*All tools and file paths will now automatically use the `feature-dashboard` context.*

#### **How to Delete a Feature Context**

This safely archives the workspace.

*   **Step 1 (Taskmaster):** Delete the tag from Taskmaster.
    *   **Command:** `task-master delete-tag feature-dashboard`
*   **Step 2 (TOFA-WDF):** Archive the documentation context (we never delete it completely).
    *   **Commands:**
        1.  `mv docs/pipeline/tags/feature-dashboard/ docs/pipeline/tags/.archive/feature-dashboard_$(date +%F)`
```

# Pickup Roadmap: A Guide for Resuming Tasks

This document is the official guide for resuming work on any interrupted task efficiently and safely, ensuring that no context is lost.

To rebuild your mental context before writing a single line of code, follow these steps in the exact order presented:

### **Step 1: Recall the High-Level Purpose (The "What" and "Why")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the Product Requirements Document (PRD) of the active task.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/prd.md`
*   **Objective**: To re-internalize the high-level goal, requirements, and the value that the completed task provides.

💡 Tip: Recreate the development environment using `python -m venv .venv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` before resuming implementation.

### **Step 2: Identify the Last Active State (The "Where I Was")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the active microtasks file. This is the most critical document, as it contains your last conscious thought on the problem.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/microtasks.md`
*   **Objective**: To understand the exact sub-objective you were working on, the plan you had proposed, and the constraints you had identified.

### **Step 3: Assimilate Past Experience (The "Mistakes" and "Lessons")**
*   **Action 3.1**: Review the log of decisions, dead ends, and discarded hypotheses.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/memories.md`
*   **Objective**: To avoid repeating past mistakes and to understand why certain structural decisions were made.

*   **Action 3.2**: Review the log of lessons learned and procedural improvements.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`
*   **Objective**: To remember if you discovered a smarter, faster, or more robust way of doing things so you can apply it now.

### **Step 4: Refresh the Final Goal (The "What Success Looks Like")**
*   **Action**: Consult the task's completion criteria.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`
*   **Objective**: To have a clear and measurable picture of the exact conditions your code must meet to consider the task finished.

### **Step 5: Resume the Development Cycle**
* **Action**: With all context restored, you are now ready to resume implementation.
* **Process Location**: Follow the workflow defined in `docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`.

Tip: Review the latest logs in `logs/` to confirm the last successful execution or identify where failure occurred.

---
This procedure ensures that every time you pick up your work, you do so with the same (or greater) clarity as when you left it.

## FILE: `docs/external_knowledge/know_task_master_integration.md`

```markdown
# Task Master Integration Guide (TOFA-WDF)

This guide explains how the **Task Master CLI** is integrated into the TOFA-WDF project structure. It maps the commands to your TOFA documents and execution flow, showing where they interact and how they are reflected.

---

## 1. Installation

Inside your working environment:

```bash
pip install task-master
```

If using conda:

```bash
conda activate <env_name>
pip install task-master
```

---

## 2. Initialization

Run once from the root of the project:

```bash
task init
```

This creates `.taskmaster/` and sets up basic project config.

---

## 3. CLI Commands and TOFA Interactions

| Task Master Command | Affected TOFA File(s) | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| `task prd "Task name"` | `pipeline/prd.md` + scaffold | Creates initial Product Requirement Document |
| `task parse_prd` | `pipeline/microtasks.md` (structure only) | Scaffolds sections for active microtask record |
| `task add_task "new subtask"` | none (CLI state only) | Adds a node to the task tree, not tracked in TOFA yet |
| `task set_task_status --task X --status Y` | `pipeline/microtasks_log.md` | Updates state reflected in logs and MCP-compatible tools |
| `task list` | CLI/interactive only | Lists task tree states and open/closed subtasks |

---

## 4. Roles and Separation of Responsibility

| Source | Responsible For |
|--------|------------------|
| `task prd` | Scaffolds project with TOFA structure |
| `pipeline/prd.md` | Defines the plan, objectives, and motivations |
| `pipeline/microtasks.md` | Describes the active microtask: includes current objective, its constraints, reasoning path, and expected result |
| `task parse_prd` | Can fill preliminary structure in microtasks.md, but does not define the plan |
| Developer | Manually writes the plan in prd.md and the current objective in microtasks.md |

---

## 5. Integration Lifecycle (Typical Use Case)

1. **Define PRD**
   ↓
   `task prd "Extract firm innovation patterns"`

2. **(Optional) Parse it**
   ↓
   `task parse_prd`

3. **Write implementation plan manually in:**
   - `pipeline/prd.md` (goals, constraints, rationale)
   - `pipeline/microtasks.md` (active microtask record)

4. **Work on code**
   ↓
   - `modules/` → `orchestrators/` → `flows/` → `scripts/`

5. **Use status commands as needed:**
   - `task set_task_status --task "X" --status in-progress`

6. **Finalize, close task:**
   - `task set_task_status --task "X" --status done`

7. **Archive:**
   - Move to `microtasks_done/`
   - Log in `microtasks_log.md`
   - Document in `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md`

---

## 6. MCP Compatibility

You can integrate Task Master into LLM pipelines, IDE agents, or model coordination by defining:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task": {
      "command": "task",
      "args": ["status"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

This allows other tools to interact with your current task state.

## 7. Summary

Task Master is not a replacement for TOFA. It is a coordination assistant.

All plans, reasoning, and documentation must be written directly in:
- `pipeline/prd.md`
- `pipeline/microtasks.md`
- `pipeline/memories.md`
- `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`

The task CLI helps track status, list subtasks, assign tags, and initiate PRDs—but never generates logic or strategies.

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_code_quality.md`

```markdown
# Rule: Code Quality & Automated Tooling

To ensure consistency, readability, and prevent common errors, this project mandates the use of automated code quality tools. These are not optional.

---

## **Note on `pyproject.toml` Location**

The `pyproject.toml` file **must** reside in the project's root directory. This is the industry-standard location that all modern Python tools expect. Do not move it.

---

## 1. Code Formatting: Black

-   **Tool:** [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), the uncompromising code formatter.
-   **Purpose:** Eliminates all arguments about code style. Black's style is non-negotiable and automatically applied.
-   **Configuration (`pyproject.toml`):**
    ```toml
    [tool.black]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = ['py310'] # Or your target Python version
    ```
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    # To format all files in the project
    poetry run black .
    ```

## 2. Linting: Ruff

-   **Tool:** [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), an extremely fast Python linter.
-   **Purpose:** Catches a wide range of errors, from unused imports to logical mistakes, and enforces best practices (including PEP 8).
-   **Configuration (`pyproject.toml`):**
    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    line-length = 88
    select = [
        "E",  # pycodestyle errors
        "W",  # pycodestyle warnings
        "F",  # pyflakes
        "I",  # isort
        "C",  # flake8-comprehensions
        "B",  # flake8-bugbear
    ]
    ignore = ["E501"] # Ignored by Black's line wrapping
    ```
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    # To check all files for errors
    poetry run ruff .

    # To automatically fix fixable errors
    poetry run ruff . --fix
    ```

## 3. Pre-Commit Hooks (Recommended)

To automate these checks, it is highly recommended to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). This ensures that no code that violates our quality standards is ever committed. A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file should be present in the root directory.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_code_review_manual.md`

```markdown
# Manual Code Review Protocol (TOFA-WDF + Git)

## Review Approach

This project uses two layers of review:
1. Markdown-level traceability in:
   - `pipeline/microtasks.md`
   - `pipeline/memories.md`
2. Git diff-based visual review before committing.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Each microtask must define purpose, logic plan, and constraints
- [ ] Code must match `microtasks.md` description
- [ ] Every new function must be accompanied by:
  - [ ] Functional inline comment above it
  - [ ] Unit test with real data
- [ ] No logic outside `simple/`, `orchestrators/`, `flows/`
- [ ] No undocumented deviation from microtask plan

No approval = no merge.

---

## Circular Dependency Policy

- Flows (`flows/`) must not reference task-local orchestrators directly.
- Task orchestrators must not import from flows.
- All dependencies are one-directional:
  - `simple/` → `orchestrators/` → `flows/` → `scripts/`
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_cross_task_coordination.md`

```markdown
# Cross-Task Coordination (TOFA-WDF)

## Strategy

- Use `flows/` as the only place where multiple tasks meet
- Never call a task-local orchestrator from another task

## Allowed Data Sharing

- Use `shared_modules/` for utilities reused across tasks
- Use `flows/` to coordinate outputs from multiple task orchestrators
- Pass outputs explicitly from one flow step to another, never via shared state

## Example Pattern

```python
# inside flows/integration_flow.py

from tasks.data_processing.functions.orchestrators.cleaning_pipeline import run_cleaning
from tasks.analysis.functions.orchestrators.analysis_pipeline import run_analysis

def integration_flow():
    clean_df = run_cleaning("data.csv")
    result = run_analysis(clean_df)
    ...
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_dependency_management.md`

```markdown
# Rule: Dependency Management

To ensure a reproducible and stable environment, this project mandates a strict policy for managing external dependencies.

## 1. Tooling: Poetry

-   **Official Tool:** [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is the sole authority for managing dependencies and virtual environments.
-   **Reasoning:** Poetry provides deterministic builds via the `poetry.lock` file, unified dependency and environment management, and a clean `pyproject.toml` standard.

## 2. Installing Dependencies

-   **Command:** Never use `pip install`. Always use Poetry to install dependencies from the lock file.
    ```bash
    # This installs the exact versions specified in poetry.lock
    poetry install
    ```

## 3. Adding a New Dependency

-   **Command:** Use the `poetry add` command. This will update both `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
    ```bash
    # Add a new production dependency
    poetry add pandas

    # Add a new development-only dependency (e.g., for testing)
    poetry add pytest --group dev
    ```
-   **Action:** After adding a dependency, commit both the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files together in the same commit.

## 4. Updating Dependencies

-   **Command:** Use `poetry update` to safely upgrade packages according to the version constraints in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    # Update all dependencies
    poetry update

    # Update a single package
    poetry update pandas
    ```
-   **Caution:** Run the test suite (`poetry run pytest`) immediately after updating to catch any breaking changes.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_doc_guidelines.md`

```markdown
# Documentation Guidelines (Minimal Style)

## Function Documentation
Use inline comments above each function:

```python
# This function loads a CSV and drops NA rows
def clean_data(df):
    ...
```

Deeper Reasoning or Process Logic

Use:
- pipeline/microtasks.md for active rationales
- pipeline/memories.md for rejected approaches or architecture changes
- pipeline/learning_by_doing.md for workflow/process lessons

---

## Naming Conventions

- Files must use `snake_case`
- Functions must use **action_noun** pattern, e.g., `load_csv`, `parse_metadata`, `validate_schema`
- File names must reflect purpose (e.g., `clean_data.py` not `utils.py`)
- No generic names like `helper.py`, `common.py`, `functions.py`
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_knowledge_management.md`

```markdown
# Rule: Knowledge Management & Architecture Decisions

To prevent knowledge loss and ensure that our documentation remains valuable, we follow a strict protocol for managing long-term learnings and architectural decisions.

## 1. The Knowledge Synthesis & Archiving Protocol

-   **Problem:** `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` can become bloated and unreadable over time, hiding valuable insights.
-   **Trigger:** This protocol is executed at the end of a major epic, a significant feature release, or at minimum, on a quarterly basis.
-   **Process:**
    1.  **Synthesize:** A designated developer reads through the active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md`.
    2.  **Extract & Formalize:** Key strategic decisions, discarded architectural paths, and permanent process improvements are extracted and formalized into **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**. See below for details.
    3.  **Archive:** The content of the active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` is moved to a dated file in the archive (e.g., `docs/pipeline/active/archive/memories_q3_2025.md`).
    4.  **Reset:** The active `memories.md` and `learning_by_doing.md` are reset using their respective templates from `docs/templates/`.

## 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

-   **Purpose:** An ADR is a short document that captures a single, significant architectural decision. It is the permanent, high-level memory of the project.
-   **When to Create an ADR:**
    -   A decision that impacts the overall structure (e.g., choosing a new database, adopting a new library for a core function).
    -   A decision that has long-term consequences and trade-offs.
    -   A decision that a new developer must understand to grasp the "why" behind the codebase.
-   **Location:** ADRs are stored in a new top-level directory: `docs/adr/`.
-   **Format:** Create new ADRs by copying `docs/templates/template_adr.md`.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_knowledge_sync_policy.md`

```markdown
# Knowledge Synchronization and Validation Policy

This document mandates how project-specific rules are updated and used, ensuring all development aligns with the latest best practices. The `docs/rules/` directory is the single source of truth.

## The Rule Update Workflow

1.  **Documentation-First:** Any change to a coding standard **must** first be documented by editing the relevant file in `docs/rules/`. The commit message for this change should clearly state the new rule.
2.  **Mandatory AI Validation:** Before applying any new or changed rule, the AI agent **must** first validate its understanding of the change. This is done by running a `research` query targeting the specific rule file.
    *   **Purpose:** This step forces the AI to re-read the rule and confirms its context is up-to-date, preventing it from using outdated, cached knowledge.
    *   **Example Command:** `task-master research --query="Explain the new required format for function docstrings." --files="docs/rules/doc_guidelines.md"`
3.  **Informed Application:** Only after the AI receives a correct summary from its research query can it proceed to apply the new pattern to the codebase.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_security_guidelines.md`

```markdown
# Rule: Security Guidelines

Security is not an afterthought; it is a core design principle. All code must adhere to the following guidelines.

## 1. Secrets Management

-   **Principle:** Secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) **must never** be hardcoded or committed to the repository.
-   **Mechanism:**
    1.  All secrets must be defined as environment variables in a local `.env` file at the project root.
    2.  The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
    3.  The `config/config.py` file is the only place where environment variables are read into the application. Other parts of the code must import them from `config`.

## 2. Input Validation

-   **Principle:** Never trust input.
-   **Action:** The assumption "All inputs are assumed to be pre-validated" is a temporary convenience for isolated development. For any function that could potentially receive external data (file uploads, API calls, user-provided parameters), perform explicit validation.
    -   Check data types (e.g., using Pydantic or simple type assertions).
    -   Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    -   Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal.

## 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

-   **Principle:** Our code is only as secure as its dependencies.
-   **Action:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
-   **Recommended Tool:** Use `pip-audit` or `safety` via Poetry.
    ```bash
    # Install pip-audit
    pip install pip-audit

    # Run the audit against the Poetry environment
    poetry run pip-audit
    ```
-   **Policy:** Any "High" or "Critical" vulnerability must be addressed immediately, either by updating the package or replacing it.
```

description: Guidelines for continuously improving VS Code rules based on emerging code patterns and best practices.
applyTo: "**/*"
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });
  
  // Consider adding to [prisma.md](.github/instructions/prisma.md):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
Follow [vscode_rules.md](.github/instructions/vscode_rules.md) for proper rule formatting and structure.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/rules/rule_test_data_policy.md`

```markdown
# Test Data Management Policy

## Folder Structure
Each task stores test samples in:

tasks/<task_name>/test_data/

## Requirements
- Use real data samples only (no synthetic)
- Prefer `.csv` or `.json` format
- Redact if needed, but preserve structure
- Document assumptions in `microtasks.md`

## Maintenance
- Each module's unit test must operate on a real example from this folder
- No function is valid without test coverage using data from here
```

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.md](.github/instructions/prisma.md) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

# Learning by Doing

This file captures workflow and process lessons learned through implementation.

### [2025-07-23] Formalizing Implicit Practices

Documented minimal responses to perceived gaps raised by external reviewer:
- Adopted markdown protocols to preempt future critiques
- Standardized our inline and process documentation strategy

Outcome: full compliance with no added weight.

### [2025-07-23] Structural Guidance Formalized

Captured and resolved key missing structural guarantees:
- Defined data test layout and naming expectations
- Codified file/function naming
- Locked architecture boundaries for flows and orchestrators

This makes TOFA-WDF auditable by external reviewers without increasing workload.
### [2025-07-23] CLI/TOFA boundary made explicit

Clarified that `task` only scaffolds and tracks state. Human writes the plan and logic in `prd.md` and `microtasks.md`.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/templates/template_memories.md`

```markdown
# Pipeline Memories

This file contains rejected approaches, architecture changes, and important decisions.

### [2025-07-23] Boss Feedback: Practical Gaps

Added minimalistic responses to six reported gaps:
- Performance: clarified in `task_contract.md`
- Security: input assumptions clarified
- Documentation: policy added in `docs/`
- Review Process: markdown + git combo formalized

No structural changes to workflow or logic.

### [2025-07-23] Structural Design Hardening

Documented protocol to prevent:
- circular dependencies across layers
- test data mismanagement
- cross-task ambiguity
- inconsistency in naming

No need to refactor existing code. Future work adheres to these modular protocols.
### [2025-07-23] Task Master CLI clarified

Integrated CLI-to-TOFA-WDF interaction mapping in `docs/task_master_integration.md`, distinguishing between execution, planning, and coordination.
```

========================================================================================================================

## FILE: `docs/templates/template_task_contract.md`

```markdown
# Task Contract

This document defines the contract for data processing tasks in this project.

## Performance Guidelines (Optional, for Data Tasks)

- Expected runtime: under 60 seconds for 1K rows
- Memory usage: not a concern unless explicitly logged
- Batch vs streaming behavior: pure batch unless documented

---

## Input Validation / Security

- All inputs are assumed to be pre-validated or internal
- No user-facing API; no injection risk assumed
- Input structure assumptions must be noted in `microtasks.md` or inline comments
```

# Taskmaster Development Workflow

This guide outlines the standard process for using Taskmaster to manage software development projects. It is written as a set of instructions for you, the AI agent.

- **Your Default Stance**: For most projects, the user can work directly within the `master` task context. Your initial actions should operate on this default context unless a clear pattern for multi-context work emerges.
- **Your Goal**: Your role is to elevate the user's workflow by intelligently introducing advanced features like **Tagged Task Lists** when you detect the appropriate context. Do not force tags on the user; suggest them as a helpful solution to a specific need.

## The Basic Loop
The fundamental development cycle you will facilitate is:
1.  **`list`**: Show the user what needs to be done.
2.  **`next`**: Help the user decide what to work on.
3.  **`show <id>`**: Provide details for a specific task.
4.  **`expand <id>`**: Break down a complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks.
5.  **Implement**: The user writes the code and tests.
6.  **`update-subtask`**: Log progress and findings on behalf of the user.
7.  **`set-status`**: Mark tasks and subtasks as `done` as work is completed.
8.  **Repeat**.

All your standard command executions should operate on the user's current task context, which defaults to `master`.

---

## Standard Development Workflow Process

### Simple Workflow (Default Starting Point)

For new projects or when users are getting started, operate within the `master` tag context:

-   Start new projects by running `initialize_project` tool / `task-master init` or `parse_prd` / `task-master parse-prd --input='<prd-file.txt>'` (see @`taskmaster.md`) to generate initial tasks.json with tagged structure
-   Configure rule sets during initialization with `--rules` flag (e.g., `task-master init --rules vscode,windsurf`) or manage them later with `task-master rules add/remove` commands  
-   Begin coding sessions with `get_tasks` / `task-master list` (see @`taskmaster.md`) to see current tasks, status, and IDs
-   Determine the next task to work on using `next_task` / `task-master next` (see @`taskmaster.md`)
-   Analyze task complexity with `analyze_project_complexity` / `task-master analyze-complexity --research` (see @`taskmaster.md`) before breaking down tasks
-   Review complexity report using `complexity_report` / `task-master complexity-report` (see @`taskmaster.md`)
-   Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
-   View specific task details using `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` (see @`taskmaster.md`) to understand implementation requirements
-   Break down complex tasks using `expand_task` / `task-master expand --id=<id> --force --research` (see @`taskmaster.md`) with appropriate flags like `--force` (to replace existing subtasks) and `--research`
-   Implement code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
-   Mark completed tasks with `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done` (see @`taskmaster.md`)
-   Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan using `update` / `task-master update --from=<id> --prompt="..."` or `update_task` / `task-master update-task --id=<id> --prompt="..."` (see @`taskmaster.md`)

---

## Leveling Up: Agent-Led Multi-Context Workflows

While the basic workflow is powerful, your primary opportunity to add value is by identifying when to introduce **Tagged Task Lists**. These patterns are your tools for creating a more organized and efficient development environment for the user, especially if you detect agentic or parallel development happening across the same session.

**Critical Principle**: Most users should never see a difference in their experience. Only introduce advanced workflows when you detect clear indicators that the project has evolved beyond simple task management.

### When to Introduce Tags: Your Decision Patterns

Here are the patterns to look for. When you detect one, you should propose the corresponding workflow to the user.

#### Pattern 1: Simple Git Feature Branching
This is the most common and direct use case for tags.

- **Trigger**: The user creates a new git branch (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/user-auth`).
- **Your Action**: Propose creating a new tag that mirrors the branch name to isolate the feature's tasks from `master`.
- **Your Suggested Prompt**: *"I see you've created a new branch named 'feature/user-auth'. To keep all related tasks neatly organized and separate from your main list, I can create a corresponding task tag for you. This helps prevent merge conflicts in your `tasks.json` file later. Shall I create the 'feature-user-auth' tag?"*
- **Tool to Use**: `task-master add-tag --from-branch`

#### Pattern 2: Team Collaboration
- **Trigger**: The user mentions working with teammates (e.g., "My teammate Alice is handling the database schema," or "I need to review Bob's work on the API.").
- **Your Action**: Suggest creating a separate tag for the user's work to prevent conflicts with shared master context.
- **Your Suggested Prompt**: *"Since you're working with Alice, I can create a separate task context for your work to avoid conflicts. This way, Alice can continue working with the master list while you have your own isolated context. When you're ready to merge your work, we can coordinate the tasks back to master. Shall I create a tag for your current work?"*
- **Tool to Use**: `task-master add-tag my-work --copy-from-current --description="My tasks while collaborating with Alice"`

#### Pattern 3: Experiments or Risky Refactors
- **Trigger**: The user wants to try something that might not be kept (e.g., "I want to experiment with switching our state management library," or "Let's refactor the old API module, but I want to keep the current tasks as a reference.").
- **Your Action**: Propose creating a sandboxed tag for the experimental work.
- **Your Suggested Prompt**: *"This sounds like a great experiment. To keep these new tasks separate from our main plan, I can create a temporary 'experiment-zustand' tag for this work. If we decide not to proceed, we can simply delete the tag without affecting the main task list. Sound good?"*
- **Tool to Use**: `task-master add-tag experiment-zustand --description="Exploring Zustand migration"`

#### Pattern 4: Large Feature Initiatives (PRD-Driven)
This is a more structured approach for significant new features or epics.

- **Trigger**: The user describes a large, multi-step feature that would benefit from a formal plan.
- **Your Action**: Propose a comprehensive, PRD-driven workflow.
- **Your Suggested Prompt**: *"This sounds like a significant new feature. To manage this effectively, I suggest we create a dedicated task context for it. Here's the plan: I'll create a new tag called 'feature-xyz', then we can draft a Product Requirements Document (PRD) together to scope the work. Once the PRD is ready, I'll automatically generate all the necessary tasks within that new tag. How does that sound?"*
- **Your Implementation Flow**:
    1.  **Create an empty tag**: `task-master add-tag feature-xyz --description "Tasks for the new XYZ feature"`. You can also start by creating a git branch if applicable, and then create the tag from that branch.
    2.  **Collaborate & Create PRD**: Work with the user to create a detailed PRD file (e.g., `.taskmaster/docs/feature-xyz-prd.txt`).
    3.  **Parse PRD into the new tag**: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/feature-xyz-prd.txt --tag feature-xyz`
    4.  **Prepare the new task list**: Follow up by suggesting `analyze-complexity` and `expand-all` for the newly created tasks within the `feature-xyz` tag.

#### Pattern 5: Version-Based Development
Tailor your approach based on the project maturity indicated by tag names.

- **Prototype/MVP Tags** (`prototype`, `mvp`, `poc`, `v0.x`):
  - **Your Approach**: Focus on speed and functionality over perfection
  - **Task Generation**: Create tasks that emphasize "get it working" over "get it perfect"
  - **Complexity Level**: Lower complexity, fewer subtasks, more direct implementation paths
  - **Research Prompts**: Include context like "This is a prototype - prioritize speed and basic functionality over optimization"
  - **Example Prompt Addition**: *"Since this is for the MVP, I'll focus on tasks that get core functionality working quickly rather than over-engineering."*

- **Production/Mature Tags** (`v1.0+`, `production`, `stable`):
  - **Your Approach**: Emphasize robustness, testing, and maintainability
  - **Task Generation**: Include comprehensive error handling, testing, documentation, and optimization
  - **Complexity Level**: Higher complexity, more detailed subtasks, thorough implementation paths
  - **Research Prompts**: Include context like "This is for production - prioritize reliability, performance, and maintainability"
  - **Example Prompt Addition**: *"Since this is for production, I'll ensure tasks include proper error handling, testing, and documentation."*

### Advanced Workflow (Tag-Based & PRD-Driven)

**When to Transition**: Recognize when the project has evolved (or has initiated a project which existing code) beyond simple task management. Look for these indicators:
- User mentions teammates or collaboration needs
- Project has grown to 15+ tasks with mixed priorities
- User creates feature branches or mentions major initiatives
- User initializes Taskmaster on an existing, complex codebase
- User describes large features that would benefit from dedicated planning

**Your Role in Transition**: Guide the user to a more sophisticated workflow that leverages tags for organization and PRDs for comprehensive planning.

#### Master List Strategy (High-Value Focus)
Once you transition to tag-based workflows, the `master` tag should ideally contain only:
- **High-level deliverables** that provide significant business value
- **Major milestones** and epic-level features
- **Critical infrastructure** work that affects the entire project
- **Release-blocking** items

**What NOT to put in master**:
- Detailed implementation subtasks (these go in feature-specific tags' parent tasks)
- Refactoring work (create dedicated tags like `refactor-auth`)
- Experimental features (use `experiment-*` tags)
- Team member-specific tasks (use person-specific tags)

#### PRD-Driven Feature Development

**For New Major Features**:
1. **Identify the Initiative**: When user describes a significant feature
2. **Create Dedicated Tag**: `add_tag feature-[name] --description="[Feature description]"`
3. **Collaborative PRD Creation**: Work with user to create comprehensive PRD in `.taskmaster/docs/feature-[name]-prd.txt`
4. **Parse & Prepare**: 
   - `parse_prd .taskmaster/docs/feature-[name]-prd.txt --tag=feature-[name]`
   - `analyze_project_complexity --tag=feature-[name] --research`
   - `expand_all --tag=feature-[name] --research`
5. **Add Master Reference**: Create a high-level task in `master` that references the feature tag

**For Existing Codebase Analysis**:
When users initialize Taskmaster on existing projects:
1. **Codebase Discovery**: Use your native tools for producing deep context about the code base. You may use `research` tool with `--tree` and `--files` to collect up to date information using the existing architecture as context.
2. **Collaborative Assessment**: Work with user to identify improvement areas, technical debt, or new features
3. **Strategic PRD Creation**: Co-author PRDs that include:
   - Current state analysis (based on your codebase research)
   - Proposed improvements or new features
   - Implementation strategy considering existing code
4. **Tag-Based Organization**: Parse PRDs into appropriate tags (`refactor-api`, `feature-dashboard`, `tech-debt`, etc.)
5. **Master List Curation**: Keep only the most valuable initiatives in master

The parse-prd's `--append` flag enables the user to parse multiple PRDs within tags or across tags. PRDs should be focused and the number of tasks they are parsed into should be strategically chosen relative to the PRD's complexity and level of detail.

### Workflow Transition Examples

**Example 1: Simple → Team-Based**
```
User: "Alice is going to help with the API work"
Your Response: "Great! To avoid conflicts, I'll create a separate task context for your work. Alice can continue with the master list while you work in your own context. When you're ready to merge, we can coordinate the tasks back together."
Action: add_tag my-api-work --copy-from-current --description="My API tasks while collaborating with Alice"
```

**Example 2: Simple → PRD-Driven**
```
User: "I want to add a complete user dashboard with analytics, user management, and reporting"
Your Response: "This sounds like a major feature that would benefit from detailed planning. Let me create a dedicated context for this work and we can draft a PRD together to ensure we capture all requirements."
Actions: 
1. add_tag feature-dashboard --description="User dashboard with analytics and management"
2. Collaborate on PRD creation
3. parse_prd dashboard-prd.txt --tag=feature-dashboard
4. Add high-level "User Dashboard" task to master
```

**Example 3: Existing Project → Strategic Planning**
```
User: "I just initialized Taskmaster on my existing React app. It's getting messy and I want to improve it."
Your Response: "Let me research your codebase to understand the current architecture, then we can create a strategic plan for improvements."
Actions:
1. research "Current React app architecture and improvement opportunities" --tree --files=src/
2. Collaborate on improvement PRD based on findings
3. Create tags for different improvement areas (refactor-components, improve-state-management, etc.)
4. Keep only major improvement initiatives in master
```

## Primary Interaction: MCP Server vs. CLI

Taskmaster offers two primary ways to interact:

1.  **MCP Server (Recommended for Integrated Tools)**:
    - For AI agents and integrated development environments (like VS Code), interacting via the **MCP server is the preferred method**.
    - The MCP server exposes Taskmaster functionality through a set of tools (e.g., `get_tasks`, `add_subtask`).
    - This method offers better performance, structured data exchange, and richer error handling compared to CLI parsing.
    - Refer to @`mcp.md` for details on the MCP architecture and available tools.
    - A comprehensive list and description of MCP tools and their corresponding CLI commands can be found in @`taskmaster.md`.
    - **Restart the MCP server** if core logic in `scripts/modules` or MCP tool/direct function definitions change.
    - **Note**: MCP tools fully support tagged task lists with complete tag management capabilities.

2.  **`task-master` CLI (For Users & Fallback)**:
    - The global `task-master` command provides a user-friendly interface for direct terminal interaction.
    - It can also serve as a fallback if the MCP server is inaccessible or a specific function isn't exposed via MCP.
    - Install globally with `npm install -g task-master-ai` or use locally via `npx task-master-ai ...`.
    - The CLI commands often mirror the MCP tools (e.g., `task-master list` corresponds to `get_tasks`).
    - Refer to @`taskmaster.md` for a detailed command reference.
    - **Tagged Task Lists**: CLI fully supports the new tagged system with seamless migration.

## How the Tag System Works (For Your Reference)

- **Data Structure**: Tasks are organized into separate contexts (tags) like "master", "feature-branch", or "v2.0".
- **Silent Migration**: Existing projects automatically migrate to use a "master" tag with zero disruption.
- **Context Isolation**: Tasks in different tags are completely separate. Changes in one tag do not affect any other tag.
- **Manual Control**: The user is always in control. There is no automatic switching. You facilitate switching by using `use-tag <name>`.
- **Full CLI & MCP Support**: All tag management commands are available through both the CLI and MCP tools for you to use. Refer to @`taskmaster.md` for a full command list.

## Task Complexity Analysis

-   Run `analyze_project_complexity` / `task-master analyze-complexity --research` (see @`taskmaster.md`) for comprehensive analysis
-   Review complexity report via `complexity_report` / `task-master complexity-report` (see @`taskmaster.md`) for a formatted, readable version.
-   Focus on tasks with highest complexity scores (8-10) for detailed breakdown
-   Use analysis results to determine appropriate subtask allocation
-   Note that reports are automatically used by the `expand_task` tool/command

## Task Breakdown Process

-   Use `expand_task` / `task-master expand --id=<id>`. It automatically uses the complexity report if found, otherwise generates default number of subtasks.
-   Use `--num=<number>` to specify an explicit number of subtasks, overriding defaults or complexity report recommendations.
-   Add `--research` flag to leverage Perplexity AI for research-backed expansion.
-   Add `--force` flag to clear existing subtasks before generating new ones (default is to append).
-   Use `--prompt="<context>"` to provide additional context when needed.
-   Review and adjust generated subtasks as necessary.
-   Use `expand_all` tool or `task-master expand --all` to expand multiple pending tasks at once, respecting flags like `--force` and `--research`.
-   If subtasks need complete replacement (regardless of the `--force` flag on `expand`), clear them first with `clear_subtasks` / `task-master clear-subtasks --id=<id>`.

## Implementation Drift Handling

-   When implementation differs significantly from planned approach
-   When future tasks need modification due to current implementation choices
-   When new dependencies or requirements emerge
-   Use `update` / `task-master update --from=<futureTaskId> --prompt='<explanation>\nUpdate context...' --research` to update multiple future tasks.
-   Use `update_task` / `task-master update-task --id=<taskId> --prompt='<explanation>\nUpdate context...' --research` to update a single specific task.

## Task Status Management

-   Use 'pending' for tasks ready to be worked on
-   Use 'done' for completed and verified tasks
-   Use 'deferred' for postponed tasks
-   Add custom status values as needed for project-specific workflows

## Task Structure Fields

- **id**: Unique identifier for the task (Example: `1`, `1.1`)
- **title**: Brief, descriptive title (Example: `"Initialize Repo"`)
- **description**: Concise summary of what the task involves (Example: `"Create a new repository, set up initial structure."`)
- **status**: Current state of the task (Example: `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`)
- **dependencies**: IDs of prerequisite tasks (Example: `[1, 2.1]`)
    - Dependencies are displayed with status indicators (✅ for completed, ⏱️ for pending)
    - This helps quickly identify which prerequisite tasks are blocking work
- **priority**: Importance level (Example: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`)
- **details**: In-depth implementation instructions (Example: `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback, set session token."`) 
- **testStrategy**: Verification approach (Example: `"Deploy and call endpoint to confirm 'Hello World' response."`) 
- **subtasks**: List of smaller, more specific tasks (Example: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`) 
- Refer to task structure details (previously linked to `tasks.md`).

## Configuration Management (Updated)

Taskmaster configuration is managed through two main mechanisms:

1.  **`.taskmaster/config.json` File (Primary):**
    *   Located in the project root directory.
    *   Stores most configuration settings: AI model selections (main, research, fallback), parameters (max tokens, temperature), logging level, default subtasks/priority, project name, etc.
    *   **Tagged System Settings**: Includes `global.defaultTag` (defaults to "master") and `tags` section for tag management configuration.
    *   **Managed via `task-master models --setup` command.** Do not edit manually unless you know what you are doing.
    *   **View/Set specific models via `task-master models` command or `models` MCP tool.**
    *   Created automatically when you run `task-master models --setup` for the first time or during tagged system migration.

2.  **Environment Variables (`.env` / `mcp.json`):**
    *   Used **only** for sensitive API keys and specific endpoint URLs.
    *   Place API keys (one per provider) in a `.env` file in the project root for CLI usage.
    *   For MCP/VS Code integration, configure these keys in the `env` section of `.vscode/mcp.json`.
    *   Available keys/variables: See `assets/env.example` or the Configuration section in the command reference (previously linked to `taskmaster.md`).

3.  **`.taskmaster/state.json` File (Tagged System State):**
    *   Tracks current tag context and migration status.
    *   Automatically created during tagged system migration.
    *   Contains: `currentTag`, `lastSwitched`, `migrationNoticeShown`.

**Important:** Non-API key settings (like model selections, `MAX_TOKENS`, `TASKMASTER_LOG_LEVEL`) are **no longer configured via environment variables**. Use the `task-master models` command (or `--setup` for interactive configuration) or the `models` MCP tool.
**If AI commands FAIL in MCP** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `env` section of `.vscode/mcp.json`.
**If AI commands FAIL in CLI** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `.env` file in the root of the project.

## Rules Management

Taskmaster supports multiple AI coding assistant rule sets that can be configured during project initialization or managed afterward:

- **Available Profiles**: Claude Code, Cline, Codex, VS Code, Roo Code, Trae, Windsurf (claude, cline, codex, vscode, roo, trae, windsurf)
- **During Initialization**: Use `task-master init --rules vscode,windsurf` to specify which rule sets to include
- **After Initialization**: Use `task-master rules add <profiles>` or `task-master rules remove <profiles>` to manage rule sets
- **Interactive Setup**: Use `task-master rules setup` to launch an interactive prompt for selecting rule profiles
- **Default Behavior**: If no `--rules` flag is specified during initialization, all available rule profiles are included
- **Rule Structure**: Each profile creates its own directory (e.g., `.github/instructions`, `.roo/rules`) with appropriate configuration files

## Determining the Next Task

- Run `next_task` / `task-master next` to show the next task to work on.
- The command identifies tasks with all dependencies satisfied
- Tasks are prioritized by priority level, dependency count, and ID
- The command shows comprehensive task information including:
    - Basic task details and description
    - Implementation details
    - Subtasks (if they exist)
    - Contextual suggested actions
- Recommended before starting any new development work
- Respects your project's dependency structure
- Ensures tasks are completed in the appropriate sequence
- Provides ready-to-use commands for common task actions

## Viewing Specific Task Details

- Run `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` to view a specific task.
- Use dot notation for subtasks: `task-master show 1.2` (shows subtask 2 of task 1)
- Displays comprehensive information similar to the next command, but for a specific task
- For parent tasks, shows all subtasks and their current status
- For subtasks, shows parent task information and relationship
- Provides contextual suggested actions appropriate for the specific task
- Useful for examining task details before implementation or checking status

## Managing Task Dependencies

- Use `add_dependency` / `task-master add-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to add a dependency.
- Use `remove_dependency` / `task-master remove-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to remove a dependency.
- The system prevents circular dependencies and duplicate dependency entries
- Dependencies are checked for existence before being added or removed
- Task files are automatically regenerated after dependency changes
- Dependencies are visualized with status indicators in task listings and files

## Task Reorganization

- Use `move_task` / `task-master move --from=<id> --to=<id>` to move tasks or subtasks within the hierarchy
- This command supports several use cases:
  - Moving a standalone task to become a subtask (e.g., `--from=5 --to=7`)
  - Moving a subtask to become a standalone task (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7`) 
  - Moving a subtask to a different parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7.3`)
  - Reordering subtasks within the same parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=5.4`)
  - Moving a task to a new, non-existent ID position (e.g., `--from=5 --to=25`)
  - Moving multiple tasks at once using comma-separated IDs (e.g., `--from=10,11,12 --to=16,17,18`)
- The system includes validation to prevent data loss:
  - Allows moving to non-existent IDs by creating placeholder tasks
  - Prevents moving to existing task IDs that have content (to avoid overwriting)
  - Validates source tasks exist before attempting to move them
- The system maintains proper parent-child relationships and dependency integrity
- Task files are automatically regenerated after the move operation
- This provides greater flexibility in organizing and refining your task structure as project understanding evolves
- This is especially useful when dealing with potential merge conflicts arising from teams creating tasks on separate branches. Solve these conflicts very easily by moving your tasks and keeping theirs.

## Iterative Subtask Implementation

Once a task has been broken down into subtasks using `expand_task` or similar methods, follow this iterative process for implementation:

1.  **Understand the Goal (Preparation):**
    *   Use `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` (see @`taskmaster.md`) to thoroughly understand the specific goals and requirements of the subtask.

2.  **Initial Exploration & Planning (Iteration 1):**
    *   This is the first attempt at creating a concrete implementation plan.
    *   Explore the codebase to identify the precise files, functions, and even specific lines of code that will need modification.
    *   Determine the intended code changes (diffs) and their locations.
    *   Gather *all* relevant details from this exploration phase.

3.  **Log the Plan:**
    *   Run `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<detailed plan>'`.
    *   Provide the *complete and detailed* findings from the exploration phase in the prompt. Include file paths, line numbers, proposed diffs, reasoning, and any potential challenges identified. Do not omit details. The goal is to create a rich, timestamped log within the subtask's `details`.

4.  **Verify the Plan:**
    *   Run `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` again to confirm that the detailed implementation plan has been successfully appended to the subtask's details.

5.  **Begin Implementation:**
    *   Set the subtask status using `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=in-progress`.
    *   Start coding based on the logged plan.

6.  **Refine and Log Progress (Iteration 2+):**
    *   As implementation progresses, you will encounter challenges, discover nuances, or confirm successful approaches.
    *   **Before appending new information**: Briefly review the *existing* details logged in the subtask (using `get_task` or recalling from context) to ensure the update adds fresh insights and avoids redundancy.
    *   **Regularly** use `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<update details>\n- What worked...\n- What didn't work...'` to append new findings.
    *   **Crucially, log:**
        *   What worked ("fundamental truths" discovered).
        *   What didn't work and why (to avoid repeating mistakes).
        *   Specific code snippets or configurations that were successful.
        *   Decisions made, especially if confirmed with user input.
        *   Any deviations from the initial plan and the reasoning.
    *   The objective is to continuously enrich the subtask's details, creating a log of the implementation journey that helps the AI (and human developers) learn, adapt, and avoid repeating errors.

7.  **Review & Update Rules (Post-Implementation):**
    *   Once the implementation for the subtask is functionally complete, review all code changes and the relevant chat history.
    *   Identify any new or modified code patterns, conventions, or best practices established during the implementation.
    *   Create new or update existing rules following internal guidelines (previously linked to `cursor_rules.md` and `self_improve.md`).

8.  **Mark Task Complete:**
    *   After verifying the implementation and updating any necessary rules, mark the subtask as completed: `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=done`.

9.  **Commit Changes (If using Git):**
    *   Stage the relevant code changes and any updated/new rule files (`git add .`).
    *   Craft a comprehensive Git commit message summarizing the work done for the subtask, including both code implementation and any rule adjustments.
    *   Execute the commit command directly in the terminal (e.g., `git commit -m 'feat(module): Implement feature X for subtask <subtaskId>\n\n- Details about changes...\n- Updated rule Y for pattern Z'`).
    *   Consider if a Changeset is needed according to internal versioning guidelines (previously linked to `changeset.md`). If so, run `npm run changeset`, stage the generated file, and amend the commit or create a new one.

10. **Proceed to Next Subtask:**
    *   Identify the next subtask (e.g., using `next_task` / `task-master next`).

## Code Analysis & Refactoring Techniques

- **Top-Level Function Search**:
    - Useful for understanding module structure or planning refactors.
    - Use grep/ripgrep to find exported functions/constants:
      `rg "export (async function|function|const) \w+"` or similar patterns.
    - Can help compare functions between files during migrations or identify potential naming conflicts.

---
*This workflow provides a general guideline. Adapt it based on your specific project needs and team practices.*

# Taskmaster Tool & Command Reference

This document provides a detailed reference for interacting with Taskmaster, covering both the recommended MCP tools, suitable for integrations like VS Code, and the corresponding `task-master` CLI commands, designed for direct user interaction or fallback.

**Note:** For interacting with Taskmaster programmatically or via integrated tools, using the **MCP tools is strongly recommended** due to better performance, structured data, and error handling. The CLI commands serve as a user-friendly alternative and fallback. 

**Important:** Several MCP tools involve AI processing... The AI-powered tools include `parse_prd`, `analyze_project_complexity`, `update_subtask`, `update_task`, `update`, `expand_all`, `expand_task`, and `add_task`.

**🏷️ Tagged Task Lists System:** Task Master now supports **tagged task lists** for multi-context task management. This allows you to maintain separate, isolated lists of tasks for different features, branches, or experiments. Existing projects are seamlessly migrated to use a default "master" tag. Most commands now support a `--tag <name>` flag to specify which context to operate on. If omitted, commands use the currently active tag.

---

## Initialization & Setup

### 1. Initialize Project (`init`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `initialize_project`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master init [options]`
*   **Description:** `Set up the basic Taskmaster file structure and configuration in the current directory for a new project.`
*   **Key CLI Options:**
    *   `--name <name>`: `Set the name for your project in Taskmaster's configuration.`
    *   `--description <text>`: `Provide a brief description for your project.`
    *   `--version <version>`: `Set the initial version for your project, e.g., '0.1.0'.`
    *   `-y, --yes`: `Initialize Taskmaster quickly using default settings without interactive prompts.`
*   **Usage:** Run this once at the beginning of a new project.
*   **MCP Variant Description:** `Set up the basic Taskmaster file structure and configuration in the current directory for a new project by running the 'task-master init' command.`
*   **Key MCP Parameters/Options:**
    *   `projectName`: `Set the name for your project.` (CLI: `--name <name>`)
    *   `projectDescription`: `Provide a brief description for your project.` (CLI: `--description <text>`)
    *   `projectVersion`: `Set the initial version for your project, e.g., '0.1.0'.` (CLI: `--version <version>`)
    *   `authorName`: `Author name.` (CLI: `--author <author>`)
    *   `skipInstall`: `Skip installing dependencies. Default is false.` (CLI: `--skip-install`)
    *   `addAliases`: `Add shell aliases tm and taskmaster. Default is false.` (CLI: `--aliases`)
    *   `yes`: `Skip prompts and use defaults/provided arguments. Default is false.` (CLI: `-y, --yes`)
*   **Usage:** Run this once at the beginning of a new project, typically via an integrated tool like VS Code. Operates on the current working directory of the MCP server. 
*   **Important:** Once complete, you *MUST* parse a prd in order to generate tasks. There will be no tasks files until then. The next step after initializing should be to create a PRD using the example PRD in .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt. 
*   **Tagging:** Use the `--tag` option to parse the PRD into a specific, non-default tag context. If the tag doesn't exist, it will be created automatically. Example: `task-master parse-prd spec.txt --tag=new-feature`.

### 2. Parse PRD (`parse_prd`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `parse_prd`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master parse-prd [file] [options]`
*   **Description:** `Parse a Product Requirements Document, PRD, or text file with Taskmaster to automatically generate an initial set of tasks in tasks.json.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `input`: `Path to your PRD or requirements text file that Taskmaster should parse for tasks.` (CLI: `[file]` positional or `-i, --input <file>`)
    *   `output`: `Specify where Taskmaster should save the generated 'tasks.json' file. Defaults to '.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json'.` (CLI: `-o, --output <file>`)
    *   `numTasks`: `Approximate number of top-level tasks Taskmaster should aim to generate from the document.` (CLI: `-n, --num-tasks <number>`)
    *   `force`: `Use this to allow Taskmaster to overwrite an existing 'tasks.json' without asking for confirmation.` (CLI: `-f, --force`)
*   **Usage:** Useful for bootstrapping a project from an existing requirements document.
*   **Notes:** Task Master will strictly adhere to any specific requirements mentioned in the PRD, such as libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, etc., while filling in any gaps where the PRD isn't fully specified. Tasks are designed to provide the most direct implementation path while avoiding over-engineering.
*   **Important:** This MCP tool makes AI calls and can take up to a minute to complete. Please inform users to hang tight while the operation is in progress. If the user does not have a PRD, suggest discussing their idea and then use the example PRD in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt` as a template for creating the PRD based on their idea, for use with `parse-prd`.

## AI Model Configuration

### 2. Manage Models (`models`)
*   **MCP Tool:** `models`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master models [options]`
*   **Description:** `View the current AI model configuration or set specific models for different roles (main, research, fallback). Allows setting custom model IDs for Ollama and OpenRouter.`
*   **Key MCP Parameters/Options:**
    *   `setMain <model_id>`: `Set the primary model ID for task generation/updates.` (CLI: `--set-main <model_id>`)
    *   `setResearch <model_id>`: `Set the model ID for research-backed operations.` (CLI: `--set-research <model_id>`)
    *   `setFallback <model_id>`: `Set the model ID to use if the primary fails.` (CLI: `--set-fallback <model_id>`)
    *   `ollama <boolean>`: `Indicates the set model ID is a custom Ollama model.` (CLI: `--ollama`)
    *   `openrouter <boolean>`: `Indicates the set model ID is a custom OpenRouter model.` (CLI: `--openrouter`)
    *   `listAvailableModels <boolean>`: `If true, lists available models not currently assigned to a role.` (CLI: No direct equivalent; CLI lists available automatically)
    *   `projectRoot <string>`: `Optional. Absolute path to the project root directory.` (CLI: Determined automatically)
*   **Key CLI Options:**
    *   `--set-main <model_id>`: `Set the primary model.`
    *   `--set-research <model_id>`: `Set the research model.`
    *   `--set-fallback <model_id>`: `Set the fallback model.`
    *   `--ollama`: `Specify that the provided model ID is for Ollama (use with --set-*).`
    *   `--openrouter`: `Specify that the provided model ID is for OpenRouter (use with --set-*). Validates against OpenRouter API.`
    *   `--bedrock`: `Specify that the provided model ID is for AWS Bedrock (use with --set-*).`
    *   `--setup`: `Run interactive setup to configure models, including custom Ollama/OpenRouter IDs.`
*   **Usage (MCP):** Call without set flags to get current config. Use `setMain`, `setResearch`, or `setFallback` with a valid model ID to update the configuration. Use `listAvailableModels: true` to get a list of unassigned models. To set a custom model, provide the model ID and set `ollama: true` or `openrouter: true`.
*   **Usage (CLI):** Run without flags to view current configuration and available models. Use set flags to update specific roles. Use `--setup` for guided configuration, including custom models. To set a custom model via flags, use `--set-<role>=<model_id>` along with either `--ollama` or `--openrouter`.
*   **Notes:** Configuration is stored in `.taskmaster/config.json` in the project root. This command/tool modifies that file. Use `listAvailableModels` or `task-master models` to see internally supported models. OpenRouter custom models are validated against their live API. Ollama custom models are not validated live.
*   **API note:** API keys for selected AI providers (based on their model) need to exist in the mcp.json file to be accessible in MCP context. The API keys must be present in the local .env file for the CLI to be able to read them.
*   **Model costs:** The costs in supported models are expressed in dollars. An input/output value of 3 is $3.00. A value of 0.8 is $0.80. 
*   **Warning:** DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE .taskmaster/config.json FILE. Use the included commands either in the MCP or CLI format as needed. Always prioritize MCP tools when available and use the CLI as a fallback.

    *   `file`: `Path to your Taskmaster 'tasks.json' file. Default relies on auto-detection.` (CLI: `-f, --file <file>`)
*   **Usage:** Understand the full details for a specific task. When multiple IDs are provided, a summary table is shown.
*   **CRITICAL INFORMATION** If you need to collect information from multiple tasks, use comma-separated IDs (i.e. 1,2,3) to receive an array of tasks. Do not needlessly get tasks one at a time if you need to get many as that is wasteful.

---

## Task Creation & Modification

### 6. Add Task (`add_task`)

*   **MCP Tool:** `add_task`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master add-task [options]`
*   **Description:** `Add a new task to Taskmaster by describing it; AI will structure it.`

## Environment Variables Configuration (Updated)

Taskmaster primarily uses the **`.taskmaster/config.json`** file (in project root) for configuration (models, parameters, logging level, etc.), managed via `task-master models --setup`.

Environment variables are used **only** for sensitive API keys related to AI providers and specific overrides like the Ollama base URL:

*   **API Keys (Required for corresponding provider):**
    *   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    *   `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    *   `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
    *   `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (Requires `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` too)
    *   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
    *   `XAI_API_KEY`
    *   `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (Requires `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` too)
*   **Endpoints (Optional/Provider Specific inside .taskmaster/config.json):**
    *   `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
    *   `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (Default: `http://localhost:11434/api`)

**Set API keys** in your **`.env`** file in the project root (for CLI use) or within the `env` section of your **`.vscode/mcp.json`** file (for MCP/VS Code integration). All other settings (model choice, max tokens, temperature, log level, custom endpoints) are managed in `.taskmaster/config.json` via `task-master models` command or `models` MCP tool.

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

## FILE: `.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample`

```markdown
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# Best Practices for Python Task Scripting with TOFA-WDF and Task Master

This document outlines a modular and disciplined methodology for managing scripting projects using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, supported by **Task Master** for planning and tracking. This approach defines clear architectural roles, separates concerns across layers, and introduces a memory-based task tracking pipeline (`pipeline/`) for iteration control, error traceability, and workflow continuity.

## 1. Organizing the Project Around Tasks and Capabilities

TOFA-WDF organizes scripting efforts around self-contained operational units. Each unit, or task, encapsulates a specific capability—such as automation, reporting, or data ingestion—and is implemented within its own directory under `tasks/`. Each task includes its own script interface, orchestration logic, functional modules, test samples, and a full set of planning and tracking documents.

This structure prevents cross-contamination of logic: each task is vertically cohesive and self-sufficient. Shared, cross-cutting functionality—such as validators, file parsers, or text normalizers—is placed in `shared_modules/` and kept stateless and pure to allow safe reuse.

## 2. Layered Architecture: Scripts, Flows, and Modules

TOFA-WDF enforces a three-tier design:

- **Scripts** serve as entrypoints. They handle argument parsing and configuration loading, and dispatch to flows. They do not contain logic.
- **Flows** implement the orchestration logic. They sequence operations, catch exceptions, and manage logic branching. They contain no I/O or CLI concerns.
- **Modules** implement atomic operations—transforming a string, parsing a file, validating an email. They must be independently testable and deterministic.

Each script executes a flow. Each flow uses functions. Each function is isolated and accompanied by a unit test. Logic always flows downward—no upward coupling is permitted.

## 3. Directory Structure and Semantic Separation

```plaintext
project/
├── tasks/
│   ├── data_processing/
│   │   ├── scripts/
│   │   │   └── process_csv.py
│   │   ├── functions/
│   │   │   ├── simple/
│   │   │   └── orchestrators/
│   │   └── test_data/
│   ├── automation/
│   ├── reporting/
│   └── ...
│
├── flows/
│   ├── data_flow.py
│   ├── report_flow.py
│   └── integration_flow.py
│
├── shared_modules/
│   ├── io/
│   ├── transformation/
│   ├── strings/
│   └── validation/
│
├── pipeline/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── task_contract.md
│   ├── task-prd-revision.md
│   ├── microtasks.md
│   ├── microtasks_log.md
│   ├── microtasks_done/
│   ├── memories.md
│   └── learning_by_doing.md
│
├── docs/
│   ├── selenium.md
│   ├── seaborn.md
│   └── library_specs/
│
├── logs/
└── config/

The pipeline/ folder contains the reflexive layer of the system. All live tracking of work-in-progress, strategic decisions, learning, and iteration happens here. The docs/ folder is strictly for external documentation and library-specific references.

4. Microtask Tracking System
	•	microtasks.md: describes the current subtask, with general objective, immediate goal, known context, proposed plan, expected result, initial and discovered constraints.
	•	microtasks_log.md: a flat registry of completed subtasks, each linked to its markdown file inside microtasks_done/.
	•	microtasks_done/: archive of all completed microtasks. Filenames follow a convention (e.g., 023_clean_nulls.md) that ensures traceability.
	•	memories.md: logs critical decisions, rejected approaches, and discarded hypotheses.
	•	learning_by_doing.md: captures lessons, workflow adjustments, and planning errors.

Naming conventions, identifiers, and classification strategies must be defined in the task’s prd.md.

5. Task Contracts and Testing

The file task_contract.md replaces ambiguous completion criteria. It defines what constitutes “done”: required outputs, performance bounds, conditions to test, and environmental assumptions. Testing is not optional:
	•	Each function must have an accompanying unit test using realistic subsampled data (no synthetic inputs).
	•	Each flow is validated by terminal output and system behavior.
	•	No script is valid without being exercised under dry-run and verbose conditions.
	•	Completion requires fulfillment of the contract.

6. Task Master Integration

Task Master serves as the timeline and controller for task-level progress. Typical commands:
	•	task prd "...": initialize the PRD
	•	task parse_prd: generate initial subtasks
	•	task add_task: manually define additional steps
	•	task set_task_status: track progress (pending, in-progress, testing, done)

Every execution state must be reflected in microtasks.md, and archived when finished. If a plan fails, it must be redefined, logged in memories.md, and the pipeline reoriented accordingly.

No code modification is allowed without 95% certainty. If below, alternatives must be presented, and user confirmation is required.

7. Philosophical Modularity and Reflexivity

Modularity in TOFA-WDF is absolute. No function crosses its layer. Scripts do not host logic. Flows do not perform operations. Modules do not access context.

Reflexivity is equally strict: no task is done without audit. If a microtask is completed, it is archived. If a solution fails, it is logged and replaced. If a method works, it is remembered.

This guarantees reversibility, reproducibility, and coherence across time. Nothing is undocumented. Nothing is assumed. Every decision has a trace.

⸻

If scripting is to be treated as a system, it must also produce its own memory. TOFA-WDF and Task Master combine structural discipline with reflexive tracking, yielding a workflow that is not only executable, but legible, testable, and improvable.

All architectural rules are defined in pipeline/tofa-wdf.md. All strategic decisions are logged in memories.md. All progress is tracked in microtasks.md. Nothing advances without being written, reviewed, tested, and remembered.

# Optimal Practices for Python Technical Scripts with Task Master

Based on the analysis of your Python technical scripting workflow and the Task Master documentation, here are tailored best practices recommendations that reflect your feedback about organizing by tasks with clear script-function relationships.

## 1. Project Structure & Organization by Task

Organize your project around specific capabilities or tasks, where each directory contains both the scripts and their supporting functions. This structure clearly shows that functions are tools for scripts within a specific domain.

```

```

### Key Principles of This Structure:

1. **Task-Centric Organization**: Each top-level directory represents a specific capability or task domain
2. **Clear Tool-User Relationship**: Functions are organized as tools within the same directory as the scripts that use them
3. **Autonomous Units**: Each capability directory contains everything needed for that domain
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new capabilities as independent directories
5. **Maintainability**: All related code is co-located

## 2. Function Design Philosophy

### Simple Functions
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function does one thing well
- **Single-Level Conditionals**: Only one level of if-else statements
- **Pure Functions**: When possible, avoid side effects
- **Small Scope**: Limited to specific domain within the capability
- **No Classes**: Prefer functions over classes unless absolutely necessary

### Orchestrator Functions
- **Coordination Role**: Combine simple functions to achieve complex outcomes
- **Complex Logic**: Handle multi-level conditionals and decision trees
- **Error Handling**: Manage exceptions from simple functions
- **Workflow Management**: Control execution flow
- **No Implementation**: Should not contain business logic implementation

## 3. Function Categorization and Naming

### Simple Function Categories

**Data Validation Functions**
- Purpose: Validate input data, return boolean
- Naming Pattern: `is_valid_<entity>_<property>` or `validate_<entity>_<property>`
- Examples: `is_valid_email`, `validate_age_range`, `has_required_keys`

**Data Transformation Functions**
- Purpose: Transform data from one format to another
- Naming Pattern: `convert_<from>_<to>` or `format_<entity>`
- Examples: `convert_date_format`, `format_currency`, `normalize_text`

**File Operations Functions**
- Purpose: Read, write, or manipulate files
- Naming Pattern: `read_<entity>`, `write_<entity>`, `process_<file_type>`
- Examples: `read_csv_file`, `write_json_output`, `backup_file`

**Calculation Functions**
- Purpose: Perform mathematical operations
- Naming Pattern: `calculate_<metric>` or `compute_<value>`
- Examples: `calculate_discount`, `compute_statistics`, `determine_tax_rate`

**String Operations Functions**
- Purpose: Manipulate strings
- Naming Pattern: `format_<purpose>`, `extract_<entity>`, `clean_<data_type>`
- Examples: `format_phone_number`, `extract_domain`, `clean_whitespace`

### Orchestrator Function Categories

**Processing Orchestrators**
- Purpose: Coordinate processing of specific entity types
- Naming Pattern: `process_<entity>` or `handle_<entity>_workflow`
- Examples: `process_customer_record`, `handle_order_workflow`

**Automation Orchestrators**
- Purpose: Coordinate multi-step automation tasks
- Naming Pattern: `execute_<process>_workflow` or `run_<automation>`
- Examples: `execute_data_import_workflow`, `run_daily_backup`

**Integration Orchestrators**
- Purpose: Coordinate interactions between systems
- Naming Pattern: `sync_<system1>_<system2>` or `integrate_<service>`
- Examples: `sync_crm_database`, `integrate_payment_gateway`

**Report Orchestrators**
- Purpose: Coordinate report generation
- Naming Pattern: `generate_<report_type>_report` or `create_<analysis>`
- Examples: `generate_monthly_sales_report`, `create_customer_analysis`

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- Be specific and descriptive
- Start with verb for action functions
- Start with "is_" or "has_" for predicate functions
- Use full words rather than abbreviations

## 4. File Organization by Task

### Directory Structure per Task

Each task directory follows the same pattern:

```
task-name/
├── scripts/                    # Main executable scripts
├── functions/                  # Supporting functions
│   ├── simple/                 # Simple functions (single responsibility)
│   └── orchestrators/          # Orchestrator functions (complex logic)
└── test_data/                  # Test data for this task
```

### Example: Data Processing Task

**Script Usage Pattern**:
```python
# data_processing/scripts/process_csv.py
from data_processing.functions.simple.validate import is_valid_csv_format
from data_processing.functions.simple.transform import convert_csv_to_dict
from data_processing.functions.orchestrators.workflow import process_data_batch

def main():
    # Use functions from the same task directory
    if is_valid_csv_format(input_file):
        data = convert_csv_to_dict(input_file)
        process_data_batch(data, config)
```

This structure makes it clear that:
- The script is the primary user
- The functions are tools that serve the script
- Everything is organized by task domain

### Shared Components

For functions used across multiple tasks, use the `shared/` directory:

```
shared/
├── functions/
│   ├── simple/
│   │   ├── logging.py
│   │   └── config.py
│   └── orchestrators/
│       └── error.py
└── utils.py
```

Import shared functions when needed:
```python
from shared.functions.simple.logging import setup_logging
from shared.functions.simple.config import load_config
```

## 5. Task Master Integration

Use Task Master to manage your script development lifecycle:

- **Project Setup**: Start with `initialize_project` to set up Task Master
- **Requirements**: Use `parse_prd` to convert script requirements into actionable tasks
- **Task Breakdown**: Break complex scripts into subtasks using `expand_task`
- **Prioritization**: Set appropriate priorities (high for critical automation, medium for data processing, low for utilities)
- **Dependencies**: Use `add_dependency` to sequence interdependent scripts
- **Progress Tracking**: Use `set_task_status` to track progress through 'pending', 'in-progress', 'testing', and 'done' states
- **Task Management**: Use `next_task` to identify what to work on next

## 6. Script Development Workflow

Follow a structured development process:

1. **Initialization**: Start with `initialize_project` to set up Task Master
2. **Requirements**: Create a PRD outlining script requirements
3. **Task Planning**: Use `parse_prd` to generate initial tasks
4. **Development**:
   - Create a task directory for the new capability
   - Implement simple functions first
   - Create orchestrator functions to coordinate them
   - Write scripts that use these functions
   - Test frequently with small data sets
5. **Testing**: Execute scripts with test data and verify terminal output
6. **Completion**: Mark tasks as complete with `set_task_status`

## 7. Error Handling & Logging

Implement robust error handling and logging:

- **Exception Handling**: Use specific exception types (ValueError, FileNotFoundError, etc.) rather than generic Exception
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- **Structured Logging**: Use the logging module with timestamps and severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Log Files**: Create dated log files in the `logs/` directory
- **Error Context**: Include relevant context in error messages (file names, line numbers, variable values)
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Provide actionable suggestions for resolving common errors
- **Exit Codes**: Use standard exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors, 2 for usage errors)

## 8. Configuration Management

Manage configuration effectively:

- **Environment Variables**: Store environment-specific settings in `.env` files using python-dotenv
- **Configuration Validation**: Validate configuration at script startup
- **Fallback Values**: Implement sensible fallback values for optional parameters
- **Security**: Keep sensitive data (passwords, API keys) out of version control
- **Configuration Files**: Use JSON, YAML, or INI files for complex configurations
- **Command Line Overrides**: Allow command-line arguments to override configuration values

## 9. Testing & Validation

Implement comprehensive testing that aligns with your terminal-based verification approach:

### Terminal-Based Testing Workflow

**Immediate Feedback Loop**:
- Run scripts frequently during development to verify output
- Test after each significant change
- Use small data sets initially, then scale up

**Output Verification**:
- Check terminal output against expected results
- Verify exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
- Confirm file creation/modification when expected
- Validate data transformations with sample outputs

**Progressive Testing**:
1. Test with minimal data (1-2 records)
2. Test with typical data volume
3. Test with edge cases (empty files, malformed data)
4. Test with maximum expected data volume

### Testing Simple Functions
- Test each simple function in isolation
- Verify single-level conditional logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use simple test data

### Testing Orchestrator Functions
- Test workflow coordination
- Verify error handling and recovery
- Test different configuration scenarios
- Use realistic data sets

### Script Execution Testing Strategies

**Dry-Run Mode**:
- Implement a `--dry-run` flag that shows what would be done without making changes
- Example: "Would process 150 files" instead of actually processing them

**Verbose Output**:
- Use `--verbose` flag to show detailed processing steps
- Include progress indicators for long operations
- Show summary statistics at completion

**Interactive Mode**:
- For destructive operations, implement confirmation prompts
- Allow users to review actions before execution

**Exit Codes**:
- Use standard exit codes to indicate script status
- 0: Success
- 1: General error
- 2: Usage error
- 3+: Specific error types

## 10. Documentation Practices

Maintain comprehensive documentation:

- **Docstrings**: Include detailed docstrings with purpose, parameters, return values, and examples
- **Task Documentation**: Use `update_task` to keep task descriptions current
- **Dependencies**: Document script dependencies and requirements
- **README**: Maintain a README.md with usage examples, installation instructions, and troubleshooting tips
- **Inline Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic
- **Change Log**: Track significant changes and updates

## 11. Code Reusability

Maximize code reuse:

- **Task-Specific Functions**: Keep functions close to the scripts that use them
- **Shared Functions**: Extract truly reusable functions to the `shared/` directory
- **Parameterization**: Use parameters to increase script flexibility
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Implement argument parsing with argparse
- **Configuration Files**: Use external configuration to avoid hardcoding

This structure optimizes your technical scripting workflow by organizing code around tasks, with a clear relationship between scripts (users) and functions (tools), while supporting your preference for simple functions with single-level conditionals and orchestrator functions for complex logic.

• El LLM puede asistir en composición, debugging, refactor y diseño de tests, pero no define el estado `done`  
• La documentación (`task-prd-revision.md`, `criterios_cierre.md`, `README`) es parte obligatoria del proceso técnico

# Best Practices for Python Task Scripting with TOFA-WDF and Task Master

This document outlines a modular and disciplined methodology for managing scripting projects using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, supported by **Task Master** for planning and tracking. This approach defines clear architectural roles, separates concerns across layers, and introduces a memory-based task tracking pipeline (`pipeline/`) for iteration control, error traceability, and workflow continuity.

## 1. Organizing the Project Around Tasks and Capabilities

TOFA-WDF organizes scripting efforts around self-contained operational units. Each unit, or task, encapsulates a specific capability—such as automation, reporting, or data ingestion—and is implemented within its own directory under `tasks/`. Each task includes its own script interface, orchestration logic, functional modules, test samples, and a full set of planning and tracking documents.

This structure prevents cross-contamination of logic: each task is vertically cohesive and self-sufficient. Shared, cross-cutting functionality—such as validators, file parsers, or text normalizers—is placed in `shared_modules/` and kept stateless and pure to allow safe reuse.

## 2. Layered Architecture: Scripts, Flows, and Modules

TOFA-WDF enforces a three-tier design:

- **Scripts** serve as entrypoints. They handle argument parsing and configuration loading, and dispatch to flows. They do not contain logic.
- **Flows** implement the orchestration logic. They sequence operations, catch exceptions, and manage logic branching. They contain no I/O or CLI concerns.
- **Modules** implement atomic operations—transforming a string, parsing a file, validating an email. They must be independently testable and deterministic.

Each script executes a flow. Each flow uses functions. Each function is isolated and accompanied by a unit test. Logic always flows downward—no upward coupling is permitted.

The pipeline/ folder contains the reflexive layer of the system. All live tracking of work-in-progress, strategic decisions, learning, and iteration happens here. The docs/ folder is strictly for external documentation and library-specific references.

4. Microtask Tracking System
	•	microtasks.md: describes the current subtask, with general objective, immediate goal, known context, proposed plan, expected result, initial and discovered constraints.
	•	microtasks_log.md: a flat registry of completed subtasks, each linked to its markdown file inside microtasks_done/.
	•	microtasks_done/: archive of all completed microtasks. Filenames follow a convention (e.g., 023_clean_nulls.md) that ensures traceability.
	•	memories.md: logs critical decisions, rejected approaches, and discarded hypotheses.
	•	learning_by_doing.md: captures lessons, workflow adjustments, and planning errors.

Naming conventions, identifiers, and classification strategies must be defined in the task’s prd.md.

5. Task Contracts and Testing

The file task_contract.md replaces ambiguous completion criteria. It defines what constitutes “done”: required outputs, performance bounds, conditions to test, and environmental assumptions. Testing is not optional:
	•	Each function must have an accompanying unit test using realistic subsampled data (no synthetic inputs).
	•	Each flow is validated by terminal output and system behavior.
	•	No script is valid without being exercised under dry-run and verbose conditions.
	•	Completion requires fulfillment of the contract.

6. Task Master Integration

Task Master serves as the timeline and controller for task-level progress. Typical commands:
	•	task prd "...": initialize the PRD
	•	task parse_prd: generate initial subtasks
	•	task add_task: manually define additional steps
	•	task set_task_status: track progress (pending, in-progress, testing, done)

Every execution state must be reflected in microtasks.md, and archived when finished. If a plan fails, it must be redefined, logged in memories.md, and the pipeline reoriented accordingly.

No code modification is allowed without 95% certainty. If below, alternatives must be presented, and user confirmation is required.

7. Philosophical Modularity and Reflexivity

Modularity in TOFA-WDF is absolute. No function crosses its layer. Scripts do not host logic. Flows do not perform operations. Modules do not access context.

Reflexivity is equally strict: no task is done without audit. If a microtask is completed, it is archived. If a solution fails, it is logged and replaced. If a method works, it is remembered.

This guarantees reversibility, reproducibility, and coherence across time. Nothing is undocumented. Nothing is assumed. Every decision has a trace.

⸻

If scripting is to be treated as a system, it must also produce its own memory. TOFA-WDF and Task Master combine structural discipline with reflexive tracking, yielding a workflow that is not only executable, but legible, testable, and improvable.

All architectural rules are defined in pipeline/tofa-wdf.md. All strategic decisions are logged in memories.md. All progress is tracked in microtasks.md. Nothing advances without being written, reviewed, tested, and remembered.

# 🔁 TOFA-WDF + Task Master – Iterative Development Pipeline (Corrected & Memory-Integrated)

This pipeline governs the complete lifecycle of a technical task using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, integrated with **Task Master** for planning, and enhanced with **real-time task memory management**. It is designed to ensure continuity, traceability, and reproducibility across sessions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. TASK DEFINITION AND MICROTASK INITIALIZATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Draft a clear technical and functional description in:  
  docs/<task>/prd.md  

• Initialize microtasks.md as a live working file:  
  - General objective of the task  
  - Current sub-objective  
  - Context of the implementation (previous & next steps)  
  - Proposed plan and methods  
  - Expected results  
  - Known constraints (to be refined iteratively)  
  - Updated constraints (as they emerge)  

• Create task entry in Task Master  
  (task prd "Describe goal of the task in one line")

• If replacing a previous microtask, archive it in:  
  microtasks_stack/

• Prepare support files for tracking (if not already created):  
  - docs/<task>/task-prd-revision.md  
  - docs/<task>/criterios_cierre.md  
  - docs/<task>/memories.md  
  - docs/<task>/learning_by_doing.md

↓  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
2. TASK PARSING AND STRUCTURAL HYPOTHESIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Parse the PRD to get a first hypothesis of subtasks  
  (task parse_prd)

• Rearrange, reword, split or combine subtasks manually

• Define expected completion conditions in:  
  docs/<task>/criterios_cierre.md  
  (e.g., specific outputs, logs, runtime behavior, correctness of transformations)

• Set task priorities  
  (task set_priority --task "X" --level high)  

• Define dependencies explicitly  
  (task add_dependency --task "Y" --depends-on "X")

↓  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
3. ITERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION LOOP
──────────────────────────────────────────────

╭──→ [A] FUNCTION DEVELOPMENT  
│ • Write each simple function (single responsibility, no I/O)  
│ • Immediately write and validate a unit test  
│ • Always use real, randomly sampled data (never synthetic or handcrafted)  
│ • Never write a script without a test  
│  
╰──→ [B] FLOW COMPOSITION  
  • Compose simple functions into an orchestrator  
  • Keep orchestrators free of logic, focused on coordination  
  • Prepare to be reused in script entry-points  

↓  

╭──→ [C] SCRIPT CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING  
│ • Write a script that takes real input and runs the orchestrator  
│ • Run it on real data (sampled) with logging  
│ • Check for errors, logs, outputs  
│ • Mark progress in Task Master  
│   (task set_task_status --task "X" --status in-progress)  
│ • Regardless of severity, every implementation issue should trigger:  
│   - Documentation in microtasks.md  
│   - Task creation in Task Master  
│     (task add_task "Investigate null cleaning error")  
│  
╰──→ [D] LLM-ASSISTED REVISION  
  • Use LLM agent to:  
    - Propose refactors  
    - Explore alternatives  
    - Diagnose errors  
  • Never act if certainty < 95%  
  • If certainty is 80–95%, offer options and ask user  
  • If certainty < 80%, never proceed — ask first  
  • If task scope or logic changes:  
    - Update prd.md  
    - Update task-prd-revision.md  
    - Update microtasks.md  
    - Log misassumptions in memories.md  
    - Log procedural learning in learning_by_doing.md  

↓  

╭──→ [E] RE-EXECUTION AND RETEST  
│ • Run again with updated functions and flows  
│ • Validate against criterios_cierre.md  
│ • If failed, repeat the cycle from the appropriate step  
│ • Log what failed, what was changed, and retry  
│  
╰──→ Always ensure everything is reflected in microtasks.md

↓  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
4. FULL VALIDATION AND TESTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Run script(s) on full-sample or edge-case real data  
• Use:  
  - Unit tests to validate functions  
  - Terminal and log outputs to validate flows and scripts  
• Confirm all validation points in criterios_cierre.md  
• Mark task as testing  
  (task set_task_status --task "X" --status testing)

↓  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
5. CLOSURE AND DOCUMENTATION SYNC
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Mark task as complete in Task Master  
  (task set_task_status --task "X" --status done)

• Archive current microtask in microtasks_stack/

• Update all relevant documentation:  
  - microtasks.md → archived  
  - memories.md → log key failures, discarded paths, reasons  
  - learning_by_doing.md → note procedural, structural improvements  
  - task-prd-revision.md → update structural understanding  
  - criterios_cierre.md → confirm met conditions  
  - README.md → only if it’s relevant to overall project summary  

• Ensure that the pipeline, workflow and TOFA-WDF documents are referenced and aligned

↓  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
CORE PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Never develop a script without a unit test  
• Never execute any change without reviewing microtasks, memories and learning_by_doing  
• Never modify logic without writing what was changed, why, and what failed before  
• Never assume a plan is valid until the implementation validates it  
• Never drop a failure without understanding why it failed  
• Never abandon a failed path without retrying or exploring alternatives  
• Never mark a task as done without:  
  - Closing the microtask  
  - Logging what worked and what didn’t  
  - Writing what was learned  
  - Documenting new strategic knowledge in memories

# Best Practices for Python Task Scripting with TOFA-WDF and Task Master

This document presents a refined modular methodology for managing scripting projects using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, complemented by the **Task Master** planning framework. It integrates a structured architecture of tasks, flows, and modules with a memory-based iterative pipeline, tracked in a dedicated `pipeline/` folder.

## 1. Project Structure: Vertical Cohesion and Layered Separation

TOFA-WDF organizes all development around **capability-specific tasks**, with each task encapsulated as an autonomous directory. Logic is stratified across three distinct roles: `scripts` for execution, `flows` for orchestration, and `modules` for atomic operations. Each task operates as an independent unit with its own logic, test samples, and documentation.

	•	The tasks/ folder contains all task logic organized by operational goal.
	•	The pipeline/ folder is the reflexive memory system for planning, tracking, and documenting the lifecycle of development.
	•	The docs/ folder is reserved for external documentation, library manuals, and technical API references.

2. Roles of Files in the Pipeline
	•	prd.md: high-level description of the task scope, objectives, hypotheses, and key steps (to be clarified per task).
	•	task_contract.md: defines success criteria, input/output expectations, constraints, and test conditions.
	•	task-prd-revision.md: logs changes and revisions to the PRD during implementation.
	•	microtasks.md: contains the active subtask. Includes context, objective, plan, expected result, discovered constraints, implementation detail, and state.
	•	microtasks_log.md: flat registry of completed microtasks (by ID and name), cross-referencing their .md files in microtasks_done/.
	•	microtasks_done/: archive of completed microtasks in individual markdown files. The filename corresponds to the identifier used in the log.
	•	memories.md: strategic and conceptual log of failures, discarded strategies, and validated decisions.
	•	learning_by_doing.md: reflects on process improvements, workflow flaws, and long-term insights.

3. Conventions and Guarantees
	•	All folder and file names must be in English and lowercase.
	•	No script or flow may exist without an associated test and log.
	•	Every function is accompanied by a unit test written against a random sample of real data. Synthetic or handcrafted samples are not permitted.
	•	Every modification or failed strategy must be documented in memories.md.
	•	Every active task must be reflected in microtasks.md and archived upon completion.

4. Directory Semantics
	•	scripts/ → receives CLI input, executes orchestrators
	•	orchestrators/ → sequence and manage simple functions
	•	simple/ → pure atomic functional units
	•	flows/ → cross-task orchestration logic
	•	shared_modules/ → reusable utilities not bound to a single task
	•	pipeline/ → reflexive control layer (not implementation)
	•	docs/ → static documentation of libraries and dependencies

5. Summary

This architecture:
	•	Separates roles with mathematical precision
	•	Provides a formal memory and validation structure via the pipeline/ directory
	•	Enables exact traceability of failures and successful design paths
	•	Synchronizes tightly with Task Master while extending it with reflexive microtracking

TOFA-WDF guarantees that technical development remains auditable, modular, and reversible. No part of the workflow exists without explanation. No decision exists without record. No script is ever developed without a plan, a purpose, and a trace.

# Best Practices for Python Task Scripting with TOFA-WDF (v3.0)

This document outlines a modular and disciplined methodology for managing scripting projects using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, supported by **Task Master** for planning and tracking. This approach defines clear architectural roles, separates concerns across layers, and introduces a memory-based task tracking pipeline (`pipeline/`) for iteration control, error traceability, and workflow continuity.

### 1. Organizing the Project Around Tasks and Capabilities
TOFA-WDF organizes scripting efforts around self-contained operational units. Each unit, or **task**, encapsulates a specific capability—such as automation, reporting, or data ingestion—and is implemented within its own directory under `tasks/`. This structure prevents cross-contamination of logic. Shared, cross-cutting functionality is placed in `shared_modules/` and kept stateless and pure to allow safe reuse.

### 2. Layered Architecture: Scripts, Flows, and Modules
TOFA-WDF enforces a strict three-tier design:
- **Scripts** serve as entrypoints. They handle argument parsing and configuration loading, and dispatch to flows. They do not contain logic.
- **Flows** implement the orchestration logic. They sequence operations, catch exceptions, and manage logic branching. They contain no I/O or CLI concerns.
- **Modules** implement atomic operations—transforming a string, parsing a file, validating an email. They must be independently testable and deterministic.

Each script executes a flow. Each flow uses functions. Each function is isolated and accompanied by a unit test. Logic always flows downward—no upward coupling is permitted.

### 3. Directory Structure and Semantic Separation
```plaintext

└── ...
```
The `pipeline/` folder contains the reflexive layer of the system. All live tracking of work-in-progress, strategic decisions, learning, and iteration happens here. The `docs/` folder is strictly for external documentation and library-specific references.

### 4. Microtask Tracking System
- **`microtasks.md`**: Describes the current subtask, with general objective, immediate goal, known context, proposed plan, expected result, and constraints.
- **`microtasks_stack/`**: An archive of all completed microtask markdown files. Filenames should follow a convention (e.g., `023_clean_nulls.md`) that ensures traceability.
- **`memories.md`**: Logs critical decisions, rejected approaches, and discarded hypotheses. Essential for not repeating mistakes.
- **`learning_by_doing.md`**: Captures lessons, workflow adjustments, and planning errors.

*Naming conventions, identifiers, and classification strategies must be defined in the task’s `pipeline/prd.md`.*

### 5. Task Contracts and Testing
The file `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md` replaces ambiguous completion criteria. It defines what constitutes “done”: required outputs, performance bounds, conditions to test, and environmental assumptions. Testing is not optional:
- Each function must have an accompanying unit test using realistic subsampled data (no synthetic inputs).
- Each flow is validated by terminal output and system behavior.
- No script is valid without being exercised under dry-run and verbose conditions.
- Completion requires fulfillment of the contract.

### 6. Task Master Integration
Task Master serves as the timeline and controller for task-level progress. Typical commands:
- `task prd "..."`: Initializes the PRD in `pipeline/prd.md`.
- `task parse_prd`: Generates initial subtasks.
- `task add_task`: Manually defines additional steps.
- `task set_task_status`: Tracks progress (pending, in-progress, testing, done).

Every execution state must be reflected in `pipeline/microtasks.md`. If a plan fails, it must be redefined, logged in `pipeline/memories.md`, and the pipeline reoriented accordingly. No code modification is allowed without 95% certainty. If below, alternatives must be presented, and user confirmation is required.

### 7. Philosophical Modularity and Reflexivity
Modularity in TOFA-WDF is absolute. No function crosses its layer. Scripts do not host logic. Flows do not perform operations. Modules do not access context.

Reflexivity is equally strict: no task is done without audit. If a microtask is completed, it is archived. If a solution fails, it is logged and replaced. If a method works, it is remembered. This guarantees reversibility, reproducibility, and coherence across time. Nothing is undocumented. Nothing is assumed. Every decision has a trace.

⸻

If scripting is to be treated as a system, it must also produce its own memory. TOFA-WDF and Task Master combine structural discipline with reflexive tracking, yielding a workflow that is not only executable, but legible, testable, and improvable. All architectural rules are defined in this document. All strategic decisions are logged in `pipeline/memories.md`. All progress is tracked in `pipeline/microtasks.md`. Nothing advances without being written, reviewed, tested, and remembered.

# 🔁 TOFA-WDF + Task Master – Iterative Development Pipeline (v3.0)

This pipeline governs the complete lifecycle of a technical task using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, integrated with **Task Master** for planning, and enhanced with **real-time task memory management**. It is designed to ensure continuity, traceability, and reproducibility across sessions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### 1. TASK DEFINITION AND MICROTASK INITIALIZATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Create Task Entry in Task Master**:
  `task prd "Describe goal of the task in one line"`
  *This command bootstraps the active task, creating `pipeline/prd.md` and other necessary tracking files.*

• **Initialize `pipeline/microtasks.md` as the live working file**:
  - **General objective of the task**: What is the overall function trying to accomplish?
  - **Current sub-objective**: What is this specific microtask trying to accomplish?
  - **Context of the implementation**: Previous & next steps.
  - **Proposed plan and methods**: How to execute the sub-objective.
  - **Expected results**: Concrete outputs, behaviors, or changes.
  - **Known constraints (to be refined iteratively)**.
  - **Updated constraints (as they emerge)**.

• **If replacing a previous microtask, archive it in**:
  `pipeline/microtasks_stack/`

• **Ensure all tracking files are present in `pipeline/`**:
  - `pipeline/prd.md`
  - `pipeline/task-prd-revision.md`
  - `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`
  - `pipeline/memories.md`
  - `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`

↓

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### 2. TASK PARSING AND STRUCTURAL HYPOTHESIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Parse the PRD to get a first hypothesis of subtasks**:
  `task parse_prd`

• **Manually rearrange, reword, split or combine subtasks** within your plan in `pipeline/microtasks.md`.

• **Define expected completion conditions in `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`**:
  *(e.g., specific outputs, logs, runtime behavior, correctness of transformations)*

• **Set task priorities**:
  `task set_priority --task "X" --level high`

• **Define dependencies explicitly**:
  `task add_dependency --task "Y" --depends-on "X"`

↓

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### 3. ITERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION LOOP
──────────────────────────────────────────────

╭──→ **[A] FUNCTION DEVELOPMENT (The "Task")**
│ • A **Task** corresponds to a single-responsibility function.
│ • Each logical step to build or modify it is a **Microtask**.
│ • Immediately write and validate a unit test for each function.
│ • **Complexity Heuristic**: A function should not exceed 400 lines.
│ • **Principle**: Never write a script without a test.
│
╰──→ **[B] FLOW COMPOSITION (The "Orchestrator")**
  • Compose simple functions (Tasks) into an **Orchestrator**.
  • Keep orchestrators free of atomic logic, focused on coordination.
  • **Flows** (in the root `flows/` directory) are a higher level of abstraction, coordinating multiple orchestrators to achieve a full business goal.

↓

╭──→ **[C] SCRIPT CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING**
│ • Write a script that takes real input and runs the orchestrator.
│ • Run it on real, randomly sampled data with logging.
│ • Check for errors, logs, and outputs.
│ • Mark progress in Task Master:
│   `task set_task_status --task "X" --status in-progress`
│ • **Regardless of severity, every implementation issue should trigger**:
│   - Documentation of the issue in `pipeline/microtasks.md`.
│   - A new task in Task Master if it's a significant diversion:
│     `task add_task "Investigate null cleaning error"`
│
╰──→ **[D] LLM-ASSISTED REVISION**
  • Use the LLM agent to propose refactors, explore alternatives, or diagnose errors, governed by `pipeline/llm_instructions.md`.
  • **Never act if certainty < 95%**.
  • If certainty is 80–95%, offer options and ask for user confirmation.
  • If certainty < 80%, never proceed — ask first.
  • If task scope or logic changes, update all relevant files:
    - `pipeline/prd.md` and `pipeline/task-prd-revision.md`
    - `pipeline/microtasks.md`
    - Log misassumptions in `pipeline/memories.md`
    - Log procedural learning in `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`

↓

╭──→ **[E] RE-EXECUTION AND RETEST**
│ • Run again with updated functions and flows.
│ • Validate against `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`.
│ • If it fails, log what failed, what was changed, and retry.
│
╰──→ **Always ensure everything is reflected in `pipeline/microtasks.md`**.

↓

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### 4. FULL VALIDATION AND TESTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Run script(s) on full-sample or edge-case real data.
• Use:
  - **Unit tests** to validate functions.
  - **Terminal and log outputs** to validate flows and scripts.
• Confirm all validation points in `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`.
• Mark task as `testing` in Task Master:
  `task set_task_status --task "X" --status testing`

↓

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### 5. CLOSURE AND DOCUMENTATION SYNC
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Mark task as complete in Task Master**:
  `task set_task_status --task "X" --status done`

• **Archive current microtask** by moving it from `pipeline/microtasks.md` to `pipeline/microtasks_stack/`.

• **Update all relevant documentation for future reference**:
  - `pipeline/memories.md` → Log key failures, discarded paths, and the reasons why.
  - `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md` → Note procedural or structural improvements.
  - `pipeline/task-prd-revision.md` → Update structural understanding of the task.
  - `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md` → Confirm all conditions were met.
  - `README.md` → Only if it’s relevant to the overall project summary.

• **Ensure the final state is ready for a future developer** (or your future self) by aligning with `pipeline/pickup_roadmap.md`.

↓

──────────────────────────────────────────────
### CORE PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Never develop a script without a unit test.
• Never execute any change without first reviewing the context as guided by `pipeline/pickup_roadmap.md`.
• Never modify logic without writing what was changed, why, and what failed before.
• Never assume a plan is valid until the implementation validates it.
• Never drop a failure without understanding why it failed.
• Never abandon a failed path without retrying or exploring alternatives.
• Never mark a task as done without:
  - Closing the microtask.
  - Logging what worked and what didn’t.
  - Writing what was learned.
  - Documenting new strategic knowledge in `pipeline/memories.md`.

# 🗺️ Pickup Roadmap: A Guide for Resuming Tasks

This document is the official guide for resuming work on any interrupted task efficiently and safely, ensuring that no context is lost.

To rebuild your mental context before writing a single line of code, follow these steps in the exact order presented:

### **Step 1: Recall the High-Level Purpose (The "What" and "Why")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the Product Requirements Document (PRD) of the active task.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/prd.md`
*   **Objective**: To re-internalize the high-level goal, requirements, and the value that the completed task provides.

### **Step 2: Identify the Last Active State (The "Where I Was")**
*   **Action**: Open and read the active microtasks file. This is the most critical document, as it contains your last conscious thought on the problem.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/microtasks.md`
*   **Objective**: To understand the exact sub-objective you were working on, the plan you had proposed, and the constraints you had identified.

### **Step 3: Assimilate Past Experience (The "Mistakes" and "Lessons")**
*   **Action 3.1**: Review the log of decisions, dead ends, and discarded hypotheses.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/memories.md`
*   **Objective**: To avoid repeating past mistakes and to understand why certain structural decisions were made.

*   **Action 3.2**: Review the log of lessons learned and procedural improvements.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/learning_by_doing.md`
*   **Objective**: To remember if you discovered a smarter, faster, or more robust way of doing things so you can apply it now.

### **Step 4: Refresh the Final Goal (The "What Success Looks Like")**
*   **Action**: Consult the task's completion criteria.
*   **Location**: `pipeline/criterios_cierre.md`
*   **Objective**: To have a clear and measurable picture of the exact conditions your code must meet to consider the task finished.

### **Step 5: Resume the Development Cycle**
*   **Action**: With all context restored, you are now ready to resume implementation.

# TOFA-WDF: Complete Architecture & Workflow Overview (v4.0)

## What is TOFA-WDF?

**TOFA-WDF** (Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows) is a systematic approach to Python scripting that separates concerns into four distinct layers, ensuring code is modular, testable, and traceable.

## The Four-Tier Architecture

Think of it as a **factory assembly line**:

1.  **Modules** (`simple/`) → **Atomic workers** doing one specific job (inside a task's `functions/` directory).
2.  **Orchestrators** (`orchestrators/`) → **Team leaders** coordinating workers (inside a task's `functions/` directory).
3.  **Flows** (`flows/`) → **Factory managers** coordinating multiple teams (at the project root).
4.  **Scripts** (`scripts/`) → **Control room** receiving external commands (inside a task's directory).

## Philosophical Foundation

**Modularity is absolute** - No function crosses its layer. Scripts do not host logic. Flows do not perform operations. Modules do not access context.

**Reflexivity is strict** - No task is done without audit. Every decision has a trace. Every failure is logged. Every success is remembered.

## Quick Start: Your First 5 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Create a new task (this populates docs/pipeline/ with tracking files)
task prd "Process CSV files and generate reports"

# 2. Check what you're working on
cat docs/pipeline/microtasks.md

# 3. See the project structure
tree tasks/
```

## The Golden Rules

1.  **Never write code without a test** - Every function must have a unit test.
2.  **Never lose context** - Everything goes in `docs/pipeline/` files.
3.  **Never build without a plan** - Use `docs/pipeline/microtasks.md` for current work.
4.  **Never repeat mistakes** - Document failures in `docs/pipeline/memories.md`.
5.  **Never cross layer boundaries** - Scripts don't contain logic, flows don't perform operations.
6.  **Never proceed without 95% certainty** - Document alternatives when uncertain.
7.  **Never ignore errors** - All predictable exceptions must be handled explicitly, and all unexpected failures must be logged and documented.

## Task Contracts & Testing

Every task has a **contract** (`docs/pipeline/task_contract.md`) that defines:
- Required outputs
- Performance bounds
- Test conditions
- Environmental assumptions

**Testing is mandatory**:
- Each function has a unit test using real data (no synthetic inputs).
- Each flow is validated by terminal output.
- No script is valid without dry-run and verbose testing.
- Completion requires contract fulfillment.

## Typical Workflow

1.  **Start**: `task prd "My task description"` creates tracking files (e.g., `prd.md`, `microtasks.md`) inside `docs/pipeline/` using the `docs/templates/` directory.
2.  **Plan**: Edit `docs/pipeline/microtasks.md` with your current sub-task.
3.  **Build**: Create Modules → Orchestrators → Flows → Scripts.
4.  **Test**: Every step gets validated against real data.
5.  **Document**: Every change gets logged in the appropriate `docs/pipeline/` file.
6.  **Finish**: Archive microtask, update memories, mark complete.

## When You Return Tomorrow

1.  Read `docs/pipeline/prd.md` - remember the big picture.
2.  Read `docs/pipeline/microtasks.md` - remember where you left off.
3.  Read `docs/pipeline/memories.md` - remember what didn't work.
4.  Resume work following the development pipeline.

## Key Files to Know

-   **`docs/pipeline/pipeline_tofa_wdf_overview.md`** → This quick reference.
-   **`docs/pipeline/pipeline_workflow.md`** → Complete architectural specification.
-   **`docs/pipeline/pipeline_development.md`** → Step-by-step implementation process.
-   **`docs/pipeline/pipeline_pickup.md`** → How to resume work after interruptions.
-   **`docs/pipeline/microtasks.md`** → Your current active work.

## Documentation Structure & Guidelines

**Important**: This project uses a strict separation between workflow documentation and external library documentation:

-   **`docs/`** → Contains all documentation related to project execution, planning, and memory.
    -   Top-level files like `code_review_manual.md` and `test_data_policy.md` define project-wide standards.
    -   The **`docs/pipeline/`** directory is the system's core, containing both *dynamic* tracking files (`prd.md`, `microtasks.md`) and *static* guides on how to follow the workflow (`pipeline_workflow.md`).
    -   The **`docs/templates/`** directory holds the blueprints for all dynamic pipeline files.

-   **`external_knowledge/`** → Contains external libraries documentation and integration guides.
    -   Use for: External library documentation, API references, integration examples.

**Reference**: For any questions about taskmaster functionality, consult `external_knowledge/docs_task-master.md` as the authoritative source.

## In One Sentence

TOFA-WDF is a systematic way to build Python scripts that ensures you never lose context, never repeat mistakes, and always know exactly what to build next—while maintaining absolute modularity and complete traceability.

# Best Practices for Python Task Scripting with TOFA-WDF (v4.0)

This document presents a refined modular methodology for managing scripting projects using the **Task-Oriented Functional Architecture with Decoupled Flows (TOFA-WDF)**, complemented by the **Task Master** planning framework. It integrates a structured architecture of tasks, flows, and modules with a memory-based iterative pipeline, tracked in a dedicated `docs/pipeline/` folder.

## 1. Project Structure: Vertical Cohesion and Layered Separation

TOFA-WDF organizes all development around **capability-specific tasks**, with each task encapsulated as an autonomous directory. Logic is stratified across four distinct roles. Each task operates as an independent unit with its own logic, test samples, and documentation.

## 2. The Four-Tier Architecture

- **Scripts (`scripts/`)**: Located within each task, these receive CLI input and execute Orchestrators or Flows.
- **Flows (`flows/`)**: Residing at the project's root, these handle cross-task orchestration logic.
- **Orchestrators (`orchestrators/`)**: Found within a task's `functions/` directory, these sequence and manage `simple` functions (Modules) for a single task.
- **Modules (`simple/`)**: Also within a task's `functions/` directory, these are pure, atomic functional units.

```

- The **`project/`** folder contains all task logic organized by operational goal.
- The **`docs/pipeline/`** folder is the reflexive memory system for planning, tracking, and documenting the lifecycle of development.
- The **`external_knowledge/`** folder is reserved for external documentation, library manuals, and technical API references.

## 3. Roles of Files in the Pipeline

- **`prd.md`**: High-level description of the task scope, objectives, hypotheses, and key steps (to be clarified per task).
- **`task_contract.md`**: Defines success criteria, input/output expectations, constraints, and test conditions.
- **`task-prd-revision.md`**: Logs changes and revisions to the PRD during implementation.
- **`microtasks.md`**: Contains the active subtask. Includes context, objective, plan, expected result, discovered constraints, implementation detail, and state.
- **`microtasks_log.md`**: Flat registry of completed microtasks (by ID and name), cross-referencing their `.md` files in `microtasks_done/`.
- **`microtasks_done/`**: Archive of completed microtasks in individual markdown files. The filename corresponds to the identifier used in the log.
- **`memories.md`**: Strategic and conceptual log of failures, discarded strategies, and validated decisions.
- **`learning_by_doing.md`**: Reflects on process improvements, workflow flaws, and long-term insights.

## 4. Directory Semantics
Here is the fully corrected version of Section 4: Directory Semantics, rewritten in English to match TOFA-WDF v4.0, which no longer uses tasks/ for source code.

⸻

4. Directory Semantics (TOFA-WDF v4.0)

TOFA-WDF has the convention of using all capabilities  organized directly at the root level (data_processing/, automation/, etc.). This frees up tasks/ to be reused for documentation or tooling outputs by task-master, without semantic conflict.

tasks/
	•	Reserved exclusively for autogenerated markdown files (e.g. from Task Master).
	•	Each .md file corresponds to a specification, PRD, or task-level description.
	•	No source code lives here.

data_processing/, automation/, reporting/, etc.
	•	Capability-specific folders containing implementation logic.
	•	Internal structure:
	•	scripts/ → CLI entry points.
	•	functions/orchestrators/ → Orchestrator functions sequencing modular steps.
	•	functions/simple/ → Atomic, stateless, reusable units.
	•	test_data/ → Local test samples for validation.

flows/
	•	Cross-task orchestration logic.
	•	Each file (e.g. data_flow.py, report_flow.py) coordinates pipelines involving multiple capabilities.

shared_modules/
	•	Centralized repository of general-purpose utilities.
	•	Organized by concern (io/, strings/, validation/, etc.).
	•	Importable by any task or flow.

config/
	•	Configuration logic: config.py, .env.sample, etc.
	•	Hosts parameter schemas, flags, environment toggles.

docs/
	•	All project documentation lives here.
	•	Subfolders include:
	•	pipeline/ → Strategic planning, memory logs, PRDs, microtasks.
	•	templates/ → Reusable templates for writing tasks.
	•	Optionally: docs/tasks/ → Symlinked or published copies of markdowns.

external_knowledge/
	•	Static references: external libraries, specs, manuals.
	•	Organized for long-term consultation.

logs/
	•	Runtime execution output, debugging info, crash logs.
	•	Optional subfolders per task.


### Compatibility with Task Master

No reconfiguration is required.
Using tasks/ as the output directory for task-master generate is fully compatible with TOFA-WDF v4.0 and no longer presents any structural or semantic conflict.

## 5. Conventions and Guarantees

- All folder and file names must be in English and lowercase.
- No script or flow may exist without an associated test and log.
- Every function (Module) is accompanied by a unit test written against a random sample of real data. Synthetic or handcrafted samples are not permitted.
- Every modification or failed strategy must be documented in `memories.md`.
- Every active task must be reflected in `microtasks.md` and archived upon completion.
- All configuration parameters (file paths, feature toggles, API keys) must be defined in `config/config.py`.
- Scripts and functions must not hardcode constants; they should reference `config.py`.
- All environment-sensitive values must be stored in a `.env` file and accessed via `os.getenv()` within `config.py`.
- `config/config.py` serves as the single source of truth for configuration across the system.

**State Management Standards:**
- All functions must be stateless and pure. Inputs and outputs must be passed explicitly via function arguments and return values.
- No function may rely on external variables, implicit context, or mutable shared state.
- Flows and orchestrators must clearly define the data interfaces between steps.
- Scripts and orchestrators must not use global variables to transfer data between phases.
- Intermediate results must be passed as return values or via defined data structures only.

**Dependency Management Practices:**
- All dependencies must be declared in a `requirements.txt` file at the root of the project.
- The project must be installable in a clean virtual environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- No module or script may depend on undeclared packages.
- Every task must document any new dependency introduced, and update the `requirements.txt` accordingly.

**Error handling:**
- All predictable errors must be handled within each function or module. Unexpected errors must be propagated upward and logged by orchestrators or flows.
- Scripts must wrap all execution entry points in try/except blocks and register exceptions using the project's logger (e.g., DualLogger or equivalent).
- Silent failure is prohibited: all exceptions must either be caught, traced, or escalated visibly.
- If a task fails due to runtime errors, the cause must be documented in `memories.md`, and the resolution path must be described in `learning_by_doing.md`.

- All scripts, flows, and orchestrators must use structured logging for traceability.
- The default logger is `DualLogger`, unless another is explicitly approved.
- Logs must be written to the `logs/` directory and support at least the following levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
- Every execution must log:
  - Task start and completion (INFO)
  - Input and output file references (INFO)
  - Runtime exceptions (ERROR)
  - Validation failures (WARNING)
  - Key control flow decisions (INFO or DEBUG)
- No script should fail silently. Every error must be logged with traceback.
- No print statements in logic layers: use the logger instead.

## 6. Summary

This architecture:
- Separates roles with mathematical precision.
- Provides a formal memory and validation structure via the `docs/pipeline/` directory.
- Enables exact traceability of failures and successful design paths.
- Synchronizes tightly with Task Master while extending it with reflexive microtracking.

TOFA-WDF guarantees that technical development remains auditable, modular, and reversible. No part of the workflow exists without explanation. No decision exists without record. No script is ever developed without a plan, a purpose, and a trace.
